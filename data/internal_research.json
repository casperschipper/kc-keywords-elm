It highlights the historical separation and recent convergence of studio and live sound realms, spurred by technological advancements. Employing literature review, expert interviews, and firsthand application of studio techniques in live settings, the study suggests that the implementation of modern audio technologies guided by a clear artistic approach, allows for the successful implementation of mixing techniques and the sound design elements of a studio production in live performances. Benefits range from enhanced artistic expression and musical narrative possibilities to precise sound control and superior fidelity, albeit with challenges like technical complexity, loss of spontaneity, and higher setup time and costs. The thesis highlights the critical role of collaboration between engineers and artists to ensure that the application of studio techniques enhances rather than detracts from the live experience. It advocates for a flexible, context-sensitive approach that considers the genre, venue, and audience expectations while implementing redundancy and utilizing techniques like virtual soundcheck in order to balance out the technical challenges. Ultimately, the thesis concludes that while the pursuit of studio-quality sound in live settings introduces complexities, it also opens up new possibilities for creative expression and audience engagement, enriching the live music landscape."}, {"id": 2842950, "type": "exposition", "title": "The role of metaphors in enhancing expressivity in piano education", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/2842950/2842951", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=2842950", "keywords": ["metaphor", "Expressivity", "piano", "Music Education"], "created": "28/05/2024", "last-modified": 1720085838, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "04/07/2024", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 1731757, "name": "Thanos Katsaras"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Metaphors play an important role in describing effectively the qualities of an emotional state due to the advantage of figurative language over literal language.

This research shows that there are important differences in the way these composers interpret the character and feelings of Mignon. One chapter is devoted to explaining Schumann's view of Mignon\u2019s personality by analysing his pieces in terms of the harmonic language and the melodic line with the texts.

It is also rarely discussed in continuo or singing treatises, either historical or modern, and, if so, never explicitly. The present experiment aims to fill that gap by examining harmony and text in actual written music. To do so, a harmonic analysis was performed on excerpts of secco recitative from French operas and cantatas written by Campra, Cl\u00e9rambault, Jacquet de la Guerre, and Rameau; the significant chords and harmonic passages were then logged in a spreadsheet with their corresponding text. Over two hundred lines of results were then analysed to determine whether patterns could be found associating certain words to chords or harmonic progressions. In the end, the dataset was too small for any general conclusions to be made with certainty, but patterns still emerged. Most notably, the plagal cadence correlated to feelings of love and tenderness, particularly in a sacred or noble context.

They show little consideration for the specific physical abilities of children at a young age when learning to play the horn, probably because those methods are mostly not written by a horn player. Therefore, I have researched the do's and don'ts behind writing a method book.\r\nIf playing the exercises in a method is not physically feasible, it can lead to frustration for the student, which, in my opinion, is detrimental to the learning process. I have always learned that moments of success are crucial for the development and maintenance of motivation. I find these moments of success lacking in existing Dutch-language horn methods. I also believe that they progress too quickly to emphasize reading notation. I notice that my own students often prioritize correctness over musicality.\r\nI have critically examined and compared the available Dutch horn method books. Additionally, I interviewed fellow horn teachers to gather their perspectives. Furthermore, I attended a lesson for young horn players at BASIS (Royal Conservatory of the Hague) where auditory learning takes precedence.\r\nI am not the first to consider writing my own method. Other horn teachers have embarked on this journey, each with their unique motivations. My research has revealed that I am not the only one who has critical thoughts about the existing horn method books. A significant part of the interviewed teachers also emphasized this same point.\r\nBased on the obtained results, I have outlined the initial steps that, in my opinion, are necessary for a starting young horn player, along with the corresponding range of tones.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nIsabelle Roelofs, an accomplished horn player and dedicated music teacher, earned degrees in French Horn and Music Education from Codarts University.

The final chapter discusses the entire process of transcribing, from the intentions behind selecting the piece to the obstacles and dilemmas that arose during the process.

As a composer primarily focused on acoustic music, I took the\r\nopportunity to step out of my comfort zone and dive into the world of electronic music. This\r\ninvolved using software, digital audio workstations (DAWs) and synthesizers to structure and\r\ndevelop my musical ideas. Despite encountering technical and compositional challenges, I\r\ndiscovered that the process of shaping form, developing materials and crafting dramaturgy shares\r\nsimilarities between acoustic and electronic composition. However, a notable difference lies in the\r\ncompositional process itself: while composing acoustic music, everything exists within the\r\ncomposer's mind and sonic imagination, whereas electronic composition allows for immediate\r\nlistening to the final sound result through the click of a button. Avoiding the trap of repetitively\r\nlistening to the piece during the compositional process was particularly challenging.

This discovery presented an interesting challenge: to bring back to life scores that had been forgotten for over two hundred years and to explore the music played in C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral during the middle of the XVIII century.\r\nMy interest on Juan Manuel Gait\u00e1n y Arteaga started when I listened to a beautiful villancico \"Voy buscando mi cordero\" by Gait\u00e1n y Arteaga, performed by La Orquesta Barroca de Sevilla with Enrico Onofri. Despite being sacred music composed for the church and for weekly mass, it was written in Spanish and carried a distinct Spanish folkloric flavour. Did Juan Manuel Gait\u00e1n y Arteaga have a connection with XVIII century Spanish folk music? This caught my attention and spurred me to delve deeper into his music, particularly his villancicos. I soon realized how little-known Juan Manuel's music is today\r\nThe line of research I pursued falls within the realm of musicological-historical research. The musicological techniques employed include those related to musical historiography, such as the chronological organization of historical-musical events, particularly in C\u00f3rdoba. Additionally, it involves an understanding of musical compositions, forms, and styles, as well as musical aesthetics, encompassing the conception of music, its functions, and purposes.\r\nThe objectives are: to understand the musical personality of Gait\u00e1n y Arteaga in his villancicos and the relation between the folkloric and ecclesiastical world in Spain on XVIII C.\r\n\r\nBiography: Born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, she finished her modern bachelor under the guidance of Gordan Nikolic in Rotterdam.

Violin treatises from the late-18th and early-19th centuries consistently encourage violinists to imitate vocal techniques. My thesis explores this relationship via the music of Franz Schubert (1797-1828), who revolutionised Lieder and used vocal techniques in his instrumental writing. Many fundamental vocal expressive devices, including portamento, have been lost in \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201chistorically-informed\u201d (HIP) singing and violin playing. My thesis aims to (1) understand the historical appropriateness of portamento in Schubert\u2019s violin music and how different types of portamento work, (2) examine why the technique was lost, and (3) explore ways of reigniting it in today's musical aesthetic. I first analysed relevant written sources and early vocal and violin recordings, finding clear evidence of frequent and varied vocal and violin portamento use, clear links in portamento use between early-recorded singing and violin playing, and consistency between early-recorded portamenti and written sources from Schubert\u2019s time. To understand why portamento was lost, I examined the wider phenomenon of style change in the 20th century and found that both recording technology and general 20th-century aesthetic changes encouraged \u201ccleanness\u201d and \u201crepeatability\u201d in music, thereby eradicating spontaneous and unique expressive devices like portamento. Finally, I researched innate emotional responses to music and portamento\u2019s importance as an engaging communicative tool, and undertook my own artistic experimentation in early-19th-century music, collaborating with and surveying leading vocal and string 19th-century HIP practitioners to explore ways of making portamento expressive and relevant to modern musical practice and appreciation."}, {"id": 995063, "type": "exposition", "title": "'What may have happened\u2026'", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/ff/d5/c9/f8/ffd5c9f8b0fbcdb73cc305659ce43e2d.png?t=d543130564dafd6819f7416f0e58da74&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/995063/1127855", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=995063", "keywords": ["improvisation", "software", "mobile devices", "remote", "online engagement.", "Online", "KonCon Lectorate"], "created": "16/09/2020", "last-modified": 1693844375, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": "10.22501/rc.995063", "url": "https://doi.org/10.22501/rc.995063"}, "published": "01/09/2023", "published_in": [{"id": 1, "name": "Research Catalogue", "name_short": "RC"}, {"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": null, "author": {"id": 54122, "name": "Johan van Kreij"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "\u201cWhat may have happened\u2026\" is a research driven by the desire to augment the sense of sharing in a decentralized improvisation-a creative musical situation in which the participants are in different locations.

Through two interviews with professional female trombone players and a survey conducted amongst 121 trombone players, I have discovered how important gender-specific role models are to the field as are a source of inspiration and normalisation for future generations. I have also learned that the challenges that female trombone players have to face are far from being over, and a very high percentage of them feel that their gender has had a negative impact on their career. Additionally, I have also explored whether trombone players engage with repertoire by female composers. Although half of the respondents had played pieces by female composers, most of them had only played one, which indicates that there is still not a good gender-balance in the programming of repertoire. This part of the research has also led me to the discovery of many repertoire myself.

Alongside a catalogue of symphonies, chamber music, and various concertos, he left us a wealth of repertoire for double bass. Namely 18 concertos and numerous chamber music pieces. However, most of these works have not been played since the death of the composer, due largely to the kind of double bass he wrote: the Viennese violone which uses a third-fourths tuning that had developed in Vienna, around 1760-1820. It is for this reason, that his compositions are nowadays not often performed as they are not well suited for the modern double bass.

Why might they want to? Is there a method that can allow any musician to develop this skill without the need for tutoring or specialised training?\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThis research began as a personal quest by one musician to find a reliable, repeatable and effective method of improving their own concert presentation. By doing so it was hoped that they might improve audience engagement with both music and artist, whilst helping to make their music accessible to a broader public. This could in turn increase the impact and reach of their performance.  Various strategies for self-improvement and independent learning have been reviewed and integrated into a simple four-step approach to be carried out with each performance where a musician chooses to speak to their audience. The resulting method consists of four R\u2019s: Role-setting, Recording, Reflection and Repetition. By deciding on a role to perform ahead of the performance, a musician sets clear goals for themselves and identifies the reasons for speaking to their audience. By recording their presentation and rewatching it at a later time, they obtain distance from and perspective of their work. This allows them to best use specialised techniques to reflect deeply and gain insight on their work, before developing strategies to improve in their next performance. This exposition presents a how-to guide for implementing the method itself, as well as background on the use and importance of each element. It also features a case study of this method being applied to a chamber music concert performance.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nPeter Bourne is a British clarinettist from the small island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands.

The result of such exercises shows how eager adults are to include an emotion in their playing which consequently is meant to improve the bond between teacher and student.

She continued her studies at the School for Young Talent at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague with Jan Boumans and Marcel Baudet. In 1989 she started her higher music education studies with the well-known Dutch pianist Jan Wijn at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam, where she obtained the Teaching Musician and Performing Musician diplomas. Afterwards, Natasja pursued further studies in the field of song accompaniment with Rudolf Jansen, which she completed with distinction in September 2000. In June 2022, Natasja hopes to obtain her Master\u2019s Degree, including an extensive artistic research project focused on the Cello Sonata by Sergei Rachmaninoff.\r\n \r\nNatasja won the SJMN (Stichting Jong Muziektalent Nederland) competition twice. She also won second prize at the Competition for the European Music Prize in Antwerp. In 2013, together with violinist Isobel Warmelink, she won the NTR prize for the best performance of the compulsory work (Music minus one or two by Guus Janssen) during the Davina van Wely national violin competition.\r\n \r\nNatasja is a much sought-after duo partner, chamber musician and accompanist, who performs frequently in the Netherlands and internationally in France, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Luxembourg. Since 1998, she works as a coach pianist at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, where she has coached and supported many young artists on their way to become professional musicians."}, {"id": 685662, "type": "exposition", "title": "Hammond organ for the advanced jazz pianist", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/685662/685663", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=685662", "keywords": [], "created": "16/09/2019", "last-modified": 1689253392, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "13/07/2023", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 685633, "name": "Bob Wijnen"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Research in progress"}, {"id": 2161575, "type": "exposition", "title": "\u201cHow to motivate students in classroom mandatory music lessons?\u201d", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/2161575/2161801", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=2161575", "keywords": ["self-determination theory", "mandatory music lessons", "Self regulation", "autonomy", "violin lessons"], "created": "25/05/2023", "last-modified": 1689252837, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": "10.22501/rc.2161575", "url": "https://doi.org/10.22501/rc.2161575"}, "published": "13/07/2023", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 1038016, "name": "B\u00e1rbara de Souza"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "My experience teaching mandatory violin lessons during school time could have been more positive.

The intervention showed that encouraging the students' autonomy was the best way to motivate them, and that can be done through simple activities that can be easily implemented in the lessons.

Action and design research were chosen as the methodology, based on which two exercises were designed and tested through the cycles. The exercises were designed based on the concept of guided improvisation, which means improvising on a given structure, specific theme, harmony, or rhythm. The first exercise involved improvising in the right hand using simple melodies in the C major scale and playing the three main chords of the tonality in the left hand, the second involved improvising inspired by Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik theme, which called repertoire-based improvisation. The exercises were tested during three cycles by a target group of six piano teachers, including those with varying levels of experience in teaching improvisation. The feedback from the teachers helped to identify key design principles for creating effective improvisation exercises, which can be used to improve future improvisation materials for piano teachers.

Firstly, although he was recognised as the main composer of Sinfonie in Rome around 1700, all of his repertoire of this genre, with the exception of one, seems to have disappeared; secondly, none of his survived orchestral scores contains evidence of the well documented practice of using winds, trumpets in particular, in conjunction with strings. To fill these gaps, speculations have tried to identify, amongst Corelli's works, not only the ones that might have originated as Sinfonie, but also those that might have included trumpets in their original form. This research moves along the same path but sets a slightly different goal: on the one hand it considers that it is virtually impossible to determine if any of Corelli\u2019s survived compositions were originally conceived as Sinfonie with trumpets. On the other hand, it argues that through a study of Lulier's Santa Beatrice d'Este oratorio - a work that preserves the only genuine Corelli's Sinfonia that has survived - and through a comparative analysis of the two Handel's Roman oratorios, it is possible to approach closely the soundscape of Corelli's Sinfonie con trombe. To achieve that goal, in accordance with contemporary Roman examples, newly composed trumpet parts have been integrated into some movements of three concertos from Opus 6. The outcome can be listened in the audio-video material part of this paper. Whether the addition of trumpets on top of a string-only movement could have been improvised, and not planned beforehand with written parts, is open to further speculation."}, {"id": 779596, "type": "exposition", "title": "Waldorf music education meets Kod\u00e1ly methodology.", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/71/f9/31/cf/71f931cf01407854986af73e9b6aa71e.png?t=71c2e5ce5afaa3b14e60e885d98c9977&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/779596/1903271", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=779596", "keywords": ["musicology", "Kod\u00e1ly-method", "Waldorf music education", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "19/01/2020", "last-modified": 1688455670, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "04/07/2023", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 708527, "name": "Raoul Boesten"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "How can Kod\u00e1ly music methodology contribute to the already existing Waldorf music education in giving the children ownership in music."}, {"id": 1935282, "type": "exposition", "title": "Singing and Playing - A Kod\u00e1ly Approach to Cello Playing", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/d5/5c/31/d6/d55c31d6cf7eefcbb037b9c43b49694f.png?t=f8a1ec0ea31bb651f6227a32f888dd8c&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1935282/1935283", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1935282", "keywords": ["singing and playing", "Kod\u00e1ly", "coordination", "inner hearing", "musicianship skills", "Cello method"], "created": "05/02/2023", "last-modified": 1688157871, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "30/06/2023", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 1380410, "name": "Alice Andreani"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Alice Andreani - Classical Cello\r\n\r\nResearch Supervisor: Daniel Salbert\r\n\r\nResearch Title: \"Singing and Playing - A Kod\u00e1ly Approach to Cello Playing\". \r\n\r\nResearch Question: \u201cWhat are the effects that the practicing of exercises involving singing and playing has on cello playing?\r\n\r\nThe objective of my research is to draw attention to the importance of developing and training musicianship skills; in this paper I will argue on why musicianship training should receive as much importance as studying the technique of an instrument. \r\nI will specifically focus on the effects that practicing exercises involving singing and playing on the cello, has on the development of a good inner hearing and musicianship skills over time, as well as how singing is proven to be an helpful tool in combination with playing, when approaching a piece from the cello chamber or orchestral repertoire. \r\nThis research is based on literature research and practice based research.

A survey spread to accordion teachers worldwide made clear that this technique is quite unknown and undiscovered. \r\n\r\nIn 4 case studies, video recordings of musical interpretations were compared using a linear bellows concept versus using 3D bellows. After intensive reflection, benefits of the 3D bellows technique became clear. Firstly, it allows a better balance between the right and left-hand manual. Different frequencies and harmonics could be discovered through the 3D use of the bellows, which could lead to more resonance and timbre nuances. Furthermore, the technique enhances direction and phrasing in accordion music, reinforced by the visual perception of 3D bellows. However, the technique should be reviewed in different musical styles: in baroque compositions, for instance, the 3D movements are preferably less explicit. Considering some prerequisite skills, an important concern in the practice process has been when to apply 3D bellows. \r\n\r\nThe research suggests that 3D bellows can be included more explicitly in accordion practice and pedagogy today.

By exercising Chekhov\u2019s concept, they acquired a sense of clarity to their character and a physical and psychological understanding.\r\nIn terms of mental preparation, the singers felt like they gained tools in calming the mind, achieving a feeling of ease. And that in general, by moving the focus from the intellectual and to the body is a great antidote for nervousness. \r\nIn terms of vocal projection, all the singers agreed that their vocal performance improved when they sang their aria the second time when they implemented Chekhov\u2019s elements while performing the aria. \r\nThere were differences of opinion among the singers as to which concepts of Chekhov\u2019s were the most beneficial. Questionnaire and discussions though brought to light that the quality of radiation and the feeling of ease appealed particularly well to the singers. I believe that the reason for that is that these qualities create an ideal physical state to sing. The feeling of ease creates a sense of ground, openness, calmness and at the same time alertness. The quality of radiation gives off a strong feeling of confidence, power, and freedom. The act of singing requires physical strength but without creating excessive tension in the body. Healthy singing requires being both firm and soft, which is achieved with both concepts."}, {"id": 1956467, "type": "exposition", "title": "Saverio Mercadante and the Neapolitan flute school of the early 19th century.

Chinese art songs indeed had such characteristics. Its appearance was epoch-making. Before the 19th century, the gate of Chinese traditional culture was closed and self-sufficient, but due to the invasion of Western powers, this gate soon collapsed. Western culture also swept China along with the military trend in the early 20th century, causing earth-shaking changes in China, in which Western music was also introduced into China. Some intellectuals enlightened by modern thoughts and knowledge believed that in addition to learning western military and technology, they should also absorb their philosophy and culture, so that China could rise in all directions and catch up with Western powers.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this research revolves around one of the intellectuals (composers) of this period, Huang Tzu (1904-1938) who challenged and responded to the culture shock through composing Chinese New Music. After studying in the United States in 1926, he returned to Shanghai, China. Like the intellectuals at that time, in addition to being proficient in various fields like science, he also dabbled in music.

If any changes occurred, what were the factors that contributed to that?\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nDuring the last decades of the eighteenth century, the field of clarinet pedagogy started to blossom and rapidly developed alongside the publishing of the first comprehensive methods for the instrument. The earliest amongst these important treatises, M\u00e9thode Nouvelle et Raisonn\u00e9e pour La Clarinette, by Belgian-French clarinetist Amand Vanderhagen, was published in 1785. \r\nThroughout his lifetime, Vanderhagen edited and republished his method twice after the initial edition; In 1799, the Nouvelle M\u00e9thode de Clarinette, and in 1819, the Nouvelle M\u00e9thode de Clarinette Moderne \u00e0 Douze Cl\u00e9s. \r\n\r\nIn this research, I demonstrate the ways in which the development of the clarinet and the changes in the musical culture in Paris affected, contributed to, and inspired Vanderhagen to modify his pedagogical model. In addition, I examine the ways changing musical aesthetics and styles are manifested throughout the three methods. During the process, I got the impression that Vanderhagen was extremely sensitive and attentive to the changes in the musical scene, as well as the advancements in the clarinet culture in Paris. Hence, between his three methods, I could spot several interesting changes in his approach, particularly in topics like embouchure, exercises, embellishments, etc. \r\n\r\nWith this comparison, I aimed to draw attention to a different thread that focuses on Vanderhagen\u2019s approach to clarinet pedagogy in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, and appreciate the ways in which the instrument\u2019s evolution contributed to the development of the method and practice of teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nNoa Meshulam is an Israeli-Portuguese clarinetist specializing in historically informed performance.

However, literature and experiences of other teachers, show us that students \u2013 even beginners \u2013 can learn to become active, self-directed learners. It is not common practice yet to implement these theories in music classes. This is why I would like to create a toolkit and a user manual for teachers that would like to incorporate autonomy supportive teaching and self-regulation in their practices. I will also create a blueprint to inspire working with blended programs in music classes. A flipped classroom can trigger an ongoing learning process in the week, it can aid students in their practice and it is a tool to reflect on teaching practices, teaching styles and programs. \r\nThe research took place in the BASIS oboe classes at the School for Young Talent, in The Royal Conservatoire of The Hague. There were 5 beginning oboe players, in the age group of 7 till 13 years. \r\nI used a combination of design and action research. With the design research I developed the online learning space and the tools for active learning and self-regulation. With action research I reflected on my teaching, students learning, development and well-being and the use of the tools.  \r\nIt was possible to use learning theories in different ways. I used tables and frameworks to reflect on my teaching, I used existing tools, I tailored tools to the age group of my students and I combined aspects of active learning and self-regulation. After three design cycles there is a blueprint of a toolkit that can be used in a flexible way and there is a blueprint for blended learning in instrumental music classes. The changes in my teaching style, the implementation of the learning theories and the reflections on the program using the online environment had a great impact on the teacher \u2013 student dialogue, the content of my lessons and the overview of the program. In students I saw an increase in motivation, autonomy and effectiveness. They are very engaged young learners, they learned to choose repertoire and strategies in their practice, they are able to plan, practice and reflect on their process and they have covered more repertoire and technique over the last year in comparison to the year before. They started sharing their music outside of classes and started thinking about their own goals in their oboe practice."}, {"id": 1484269, "type": "exposition", "title": "The Kod\u00e1ly effect: Measuring musical literacy in Dutch primary school children", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/93/82/08/b2/938208b24e57282cb614054c10482d46.png?t=a51551374e24c1be695330cb921cfe98&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1484269/1484270", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1484269", "keywords": ["musical literacy", "Kod\u00e1ly", "music literacy", "musical aptitude"], "created": "07/01/2022", "last-modified": 1670405945, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "07/12/2022", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 1007100, "name": "Ingrid Roig"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Ingrid Roig\r\nMain Subject: Music Education according to the Kod\u00e1ly Concept \r\nResearch Supervisor: Suzanne Konings\r\n\r\nTitle of Research:\r\nThe Kod\u00e1ly Effect: measuring musical literacy in Dutch primary school children.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Question:\r\nWhat is the effect of Kod\u00e1ly inspired music education on musical literacy in Dutch primary school children and how can musical literacy be measured?\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nRecent years have shown a growing effort to increase the number of music lessons in Dutch primary schools. Nonetheless, an apt way to track children\u2019s individual musical development is currently lacking, and no studies have been conducted to investigate the beneficial effects on musical literacy. The Kod\u00e1ly approach to music strongly emphasizes musical literacy, and prior research shows evidence of a positive impact on specific music skills. \r\n\r\nThis thesis presents a study investigating the effect of Kod\u00e1ly inspired music education on the musical literacy scores of one hundred and thirty-four Dutch primary school children, Mage = 8.72 years. Children were randomized into two groups: a Kod\u00e1ly music intervention group and a control group. Gordon\u2019s IOWA Tests of Music Literacy provided data on musical literacy outcomes. A Musical Aptitude test assessed the learning potential for music. \r\n\r\nMusical literacy increased significantly in the music intervention group compared to the control group. Children with a high musical aptitude showed greater improvement in musical literacy scores than children with a low musical aptitude. The present results indicate a beneficial influence of Kod\u00e1ly music education on musical literacy.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the study, the focus lies on developing a Dutch instrument and materials to measure and track the individual musical literacy development of Dutch primary school children. A pilot version and materials that music teachers can use in their classrooms are presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nIngrid Roig (Argentina, 1986) studied Psychology and Developmental & Educational Psychology at Leiden University with a special interest in learning potential.

His huge oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ, composed 1965-1969, includes two entirely homorhythmic movements entitled \u2018Choral\u2019. As a listener, I am fascinated by Messiaen's extraordinary approach to harmony. The aim of this research is, therefore, to attempt to understand how best to analyse Messiaen's unique harmonic language.\r\nMany approaches to analysing Messiaen\u2019s music are vertically orientated, including his own way of describing his use of harmony. He himself never discussed the horizontal aspects of his music. Because of his coloured hearing synaesthesia (son-couleur), Messiaen's analyses are particularly special in their manner of addressing the colours of certain chords. A colour analysis by Messiaen therefore may give the listener some insight in the way Messiaen might have perceived his music. This research includes videos with the music and paintings of the colour analyses by Messiaen and two other musicians with synaesthesia of one of the chorales, specially made for this research.  \r\nConsidering Messiaen\u2019s own lack of emphasis on horizontal aspects of his music, is it possible to understand Messiaen\u2019s music from a horizontal perspective as well? Since the two chorales are homophonic and homorhythmic, the bass and soprano are the most important voices. These parts can be perceived clearly, but the attention of the listener is also caught by other aspects such as the complexity of the chords. It is difficult to determine the precise voice leading of the inner parts because it is \u2018blurred\u2019 by the varied orchestration, but by way of harmonic reductions of the chorales, Messiaen\u2019s horizontal compositional techniques can be clarified. This research includes a harmonisation of a melody by Messiaen in the style of the chorales in La Transfiguration.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\n\r\nArjen Berends teaches music theory and arranging at the conservatories of The Hague and Utrecht.

So that is why the main question of this work is how to approach Tango music for double bass using a German bow technique? To answer this question I have been studying  the method \"The bass in tango\" published by Tango sin fin, that approaches all of the elements from the perspective of the French bow. However, I have studied this using the German bow technique. I have found that you can play Tango with both techniques, but you cannot follow the same instructions to find the same results. This is  mainly because of the anatomy of the bow. Additionally, because there is not a strong tradition outside of Argentina of typical orchestras or soloists that play beyond Piazzolla the tradition of playing with a French bow is still strong.

Therefore, violinists need to get some sound simplicity such as no vibrato or playing in the first position. On the other hand, the lyrical parts are very contrasting. Szymanowski was inspired by singers and the way his dear violinist friend Pawe\u0142 Kocha\u0144ski played.

Among other titles, Jefferson was a statesman, diplomat, slave master, and avid violinist. He is remembered as the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and third U.S. President. Early documentation suggests he was a gifted musician, reading notation at age nine and practicing \u201cno less than three hours a day\u201d for \u201ca dozen years\u201d. Music played an important role in the courtship of his wife, Martha Skelton Wayles, a harpsichordist and singer. They parented six children, of which two daughters survived to adulthood. Both received substantial keyboard training and their eldest inherited her father\u2019s \u201ctaste and talent for music\u201d. Upon their mother's death in 1782, Thomas began a complicated relationship with his late wife\u2019s enslaved half sister, Sally Hemings. She became pregnant at sixteen and bore six of Jefferson\u2019s children, four of which survived to adulthood. While Jefferson\u2019s white daughters learned keyboard, two of his enslaved black sons were taught violin. It is likely that Jefferson himself taught them using the treatises of his expansive musical library, notably Geminani\u2019s \u201cArt of Playing the Violin\u201d. A year after Jefferson\u2019s death, the two sons were given their freedom; the youngest\u2019s profession is listed as \u201cmusician\u201d in the 1850 census; he is remembered as an \u201caccomplished caller of dances\u201d. These sons span the full stylistic gamut available in 19th century American music: from fiddle to violin. Thomas Jefferson and his family represent the kernels of America\u2019s musical traditions, and the way they have morphed in parallel with America itself.

The use of the voice is strongly tied with joy, self-confidence, self-realisation, personality and, in the end, life. We use our voices daily and for everything, such as communicating, sighing, laughing, crying and, of course, singing. The voice is our own built-in instrument that can be use freely to make music. Because we carry it with us and it is such an important part of our bodies, it is a personal one. Often singers feel that criticism of their voice is an attack on who they are and their musicality. It is as unique as a fingerprint and it reveals who you are immediately. My theory is that if singers are trapped in a negative environment it can cause them to sing in a way that is not true to their voice or, in the worst case, stop singing.

In its essence, this research is a response to a question that was motivated by my relation to these two very different musical cultures and genres. The principal question I seek to answer in this research is about determining if it is possible to integrate Iranian folk music (IFM) into an existing genre of global contemporary popular music, such as EDM or any branch and sub-genre within this categorization?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, I first investigated the general characteristics and attributes of both Iranian folk music and EDM, largely with respect to their musical and performative aspects. Based on these findings, I selected four recordings/samples of Iranian folk music and researched ways to integrate these four samples with an EDM subgenre, namely, Techno. Next, I analyzed both Techno and those four specific samples of IFM\u2019s samples, examining both genres in terms of their composition, harmony, rhythm, and aspects of musical production - largely exploring and documenting their similarities and differences. This thesis also includes details on how using selections/samples/pieces from EDM and IFM as source material involved long periods of time in the studio, whereby I tried many different approaches of production and eventually developed a software tool which helped me to establish a practical bridge between these two different musical cultures/genres. Consequently, this provided a viable answer to my research question. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, I now present my conclusions, practical findings, and experiences alongside a series of video recordings. This media explains how I manipulated and used IFM samples and EDM techniques - with the usage of particular music production software - to create new ideas within the Techno subgenre. These videos also explain many other practical and relevant approaches to the process and techniques I used to make the final result from this research: the development of an application that works as a tool for integrating different musical cultures. \r\n\r\nFinally, this research culminated in making a 20 minutes Techno set, which serves as a quick musical representation of a potential product based on the integration of these two types of musical styles.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nRouzbeh Esfandarmaz (born 1985 in Tehran, Iran) is a multi-instrumentalist, performer, composer, music producer, and an entrepreneur who has been active in Iran for numerous years.

During my discussion, I incorporate examples of excerpts from the flute repertoire, consider the harmonic language used and function of musical structures, and balance this against the resulting emotional response from us. \r\n\r\nThis initial discussion is in support of a questionnaire which I conducted in order to gather results from respondents of their perceived emotional response and valence when presented with differing musical excerpts, both upon an initial and second listening. I  aimed to gauge and qualify their reaction to musical traits which have been connected more strongly than others to specific emotional states, and additionally I was interested to find if there was a connection between memory of a piece of music, and emotional valence due to this familiarity. \r\n\r\nFinally, having demonstrated the emotive strength it is possible for music to hold, I investigate how as artists we can harness and emphasise certain functions of music to create performances which are highly engaging and positively affecting for listeners.

The thesis of this paper is that re-adopting the practice of reading from mensural notation as printed in part-books/choirbooks influences the experience and the outcome of the performance for both the singers and the audience.\r\nInterviews reveal that there is a different way of looking at polyphony when using mensural notation, as you are forced to listen to the others to stay together (whereas in modern scores, one could also look). Reading from choirbooks has the effect of creating a greater togetherness and synergy in between the singers. The absence of barlines in the scores creates a reliance on and a better feeling for what is called \u2018tactus\u2019. A significant practical disadvantage is that due to the lack of experience in reading mensural notation in a majority of singers, it takes more time and practice/rehearsals to get to a concert-worthy level, which in a \u2018time-is-money\u2019 world is not so desirable. Modern-day sources addressing the advantages and disadvantages of using mensural notation in polyphony performances nowadays are almost entirely lacking.

Summary of the results of the research and an explanation of the chosen format of presentation:\r\n\r\nThis research project is a \u201cquick guide\u201d for the Trumpet Concerto composed by Korean composer Jong-Uek Woo.This Trumpet Concerto is influenced by Korean traditional music and uses traditional elements such as Korean rhythmic patterns, traditional instrument sounds, and singing styles. After observing non- Korean trumpet players play this piece a few years ago at the Jeju International Brass-Percussion Competition in Korea, I was motivated to create this quick guide for non-Korean players. This research introduces composer Jong-Uek Woo and explains Korean traditional music materials and how to practice and perform this work. For trumpet players, I have created the quick guide to understand and perform it better. While analyzing it, I found out that the concerto was similar to Sanjo, a form of solo instrumental music and that it can be applied to the performance of Daegeum, a Korean traditional bamboo flute. Thus, four Daegeum techniques were applied to this method of playing this piece, and I explained which mutes can mimic the sound of Daegeum as closely as possible. This research also explains the various rhythm patterns of Korean traditional music Jangdan, which is difficult to be expressed by modern staff notation. \r\n\r\n7.

The exposition is divided into four sections.\r\n\r\nThe first section explores the background for the research, including my existing interest in the topic and covers I had already made. This section includes interviews with established figures in the hip hop/string instrument space.\r\n\r\nThe second section explores various artists\u2019 existing work in this area. It begins with a broad overview of the existing canon and history of hip hop on string instruments, and continues with an in-depth analysis of three artists in this space. This section uses defined criteria such as rhythm, pitch, timbre, and others, to analyze various attempts at recreating spoken word music on string instruments.\r\n\r\nSection three is an examination of my attempts at recreating spoken word media on string instruments. It begins with a brief overview of my previous covers, and continues with an in-depth analysis, using the criteria as defined in section two, of my covers \u201cKanye Rant\u201d by Bo Burnham, as well as Biggie Smalls\u2019 \u201cBig Poppa\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe research concludes with an evaluation of whether or not my covers were successful and why. This section then expands outward to provide a rough guide for how to create spoken word media on string instruments effectively. The exposition concludes with a brief exploration of how one could successfully create original compositions in such genres on string instruments."}, {"id": 1491174, "type": "exposition", "title": "The Mysterious Joe Henderson", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/fe/9b/3e/3e/fe9b3e3e4e86b6b730e1acfaff2d5aeb.png?t=91813c51b005940a2c587dcf1a56d655&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1491174/1491175", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1491174", "keywords": ["Joe Henderson", "jazz saxophone", "improvisation", "jazz"], "created": "13/01/2022", "last-modified": 1657539163, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "11/07/2022", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "public-domain", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 1101413, "name": "Lam ChakSeng"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to delve into the performance of the great jazz tenor saxophone Joe Henderson, and to understand his uniqueness in different aspects of his performance.

One of the biggest differences between these two periods was the type of instrument: the classical instrument had few keys (it was more difficult technically) and had a simple open sound. Instead, after a century the romantic instrument was innovative because it was equipped with many more keys (therefore it exalted the virtuosity of the clarinettist) and many sound colours could be obtained.

Over the last 50 years there have been many suggestions on how to allow the professional field of classical music to develop alongside its time and people.\r\nTo get a new perspective on the topic, I approach ASMR as a connected topic, investigate it under the aspect of listening and then make a transfer to my professional practice. ASMR stands for autonomous sensuous meridian response and is describing a special kind of sensory perception. I study ASMR as way of perception and as well as a YouTube / media phenomenon. \r\nMy research question is:\r\n What can I learn from ASMR (about contemporary audience\u2019s perception of sound) and how can I integrate this in my artistic practice?\r\nWhen I talked to colleagues or teachers from a classical music context, ASMR appeared to them at first as something bizarre and insignificant. Still, it has millions of followers on the internet. A large number of followers is not necessarily an indicator of artistic quality, but it can certainly be an argument to arouse curiosity. After all, the number of followers towards a subject does say something about its appeal or the ability to grasp people.\r\nBy comparing ASMR to synaesthesia, I want to focus on perception and sensuousness but also explore common traits and differences of the two phenomena as both neurological phenomenon and the social (artistic) movement.\r\nAn analysis and five experiments involving technological and dramaturgical tools often used in ASMR, leads to the final chapter: the artistic implementation. During the two years of my master studies, I designed two performance concepts, in which I applied the insights I gained throughout this research. A documentation of the process and a more elaborate explanation of the concept are to be found in chapter 4. \r\nIn the end of this exposition, I summarize the conclusions of the research I made on a general and on a personal level.\r\nIn order to acquire more information as well as a wider view, I have reached out to literature within the fields of sociology, (social) history, psychology, neuroscience and philosophy .

Handel arrived in London for the first time in 1710 at the age of twenty-five. By 1723, the well established composer had leased the Brook Street house in which he spent the remainder of his life. An active socialite, Handel frequently attended house concerts where music was performed in a smaller setting.

These works were intended for the salon settings of which he was so fond and were beneficial in growing his fame. House concerts became a sort of laboratory where he presented themes that he later adapted into larger, more public compositions. Written for poet and university friend Barthold Brockes, the Neun Deutsche Arien are scored for voice, continuo, and obligatto flute or violin.

In order to get there however, we must experience the challenge of an audition. Playing in an audition is always difficult and finding effective ways to prepare for it are crucial, if we are to be successful. This is one of the reasons why I have decided to focus my research on finding effective practicing strategies for two orchestral excerpts: Richard Strauss\u2019s \u201cEin Heldenleben\u201d and Robert Schumann\u2019s symphony no.3 \u201cRhenish\u201d. These two pieces have many different characteristics, such as historical context, musical style, the use of the instrument. Through this research I aimed to get closer to finding how can we get to know the orchestral excerpts well and perform them as proficiently as possible in the moment of audition.\r\n\r\nThe main topic of my research is how to prepare orchestral excerpts for bass trombone and more specifically, how to find approaches and practicing strategies. In order to do this, I formulated my main research question, which is: how can we identify the main difficulties and devise effective practicing strategies for preparing orchestral excerpts? For this purpose, I chose the two above-mentioned case studies on which we will focus below. In order to further focus my research, I identified a number of sub-questions that guided my process: What points should we be aware when preparing for bass trombone orchestral excerpts? How to set up practice strategies and deal with technical challenges in the excerpts, such as, register jump, sound consistency and air coherence in different dynamics, clear articulation and sound idea? How can we formulate exercises that aim to prepare specific bass trombone orchestral excerpts, instead of simply practicing the most common exercises from etude books? How can we create an even and full sound in parts with loud dynamics? What is the guidance for interpreting the tranquil or expressive parts? Most of these sub-questions came up while I was preparing and practicing the orchestral excerpts, and I think these questions include some of the main challenges one will encounter when practicing orchestral excerpts. In the following text I will discuss the two bass trombone orchestral excerpts, I will analyze their difficulties and propose different ideas for practicing and interpretation. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the main reason that motivated me to focus on the topic of how to prepare excerpts is that as far as I know there are almost no bass trombone etude books whose aims are particular to practice orchestral excerpts. For a long time in the past, when I practiced orchestral excerpts, I just played each of them, perhaps simply started from the slow tempo or gentle dynamic, and simply repeated it, and played the whole thing in the way of what the excerpts were supposed to be finally. I love playing orchestral pieces, but to be honest, I was not really aware of different ways in which I could practice them. The turning point, when I got clearly different ideas about playing orchestral excerpts, happened when I started working with my former teacher, Brandt Attema, who was my first bass trombone teacher when I began my studies in the Netherlands in September 2018. He really emphasized that when we practice to play music, we should give the music the certain corresponding imagination in the way of playing, rather than only playing notes numbly and straightforwardly. And as long as you have your own interpretation, it does not matter if people\u2019s individual ideas are the same or not because everyone is unique and independent. So, the point is that you must have something in mind. Moreover, he also gave me many ideas how to investigate and compose exercises from pieces I am playing, not only in case of the solo repertoire, but also orchestral excerpts. From then on, I felt like finding a new world and really got a magical inspiration. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to practically look into and sort out the approaches of how to build up the foundation of playing orchestral excerpts and practicing the excerpts from exactly the orchestral excerpts which we are struggling with at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I had practiced many different exercises from many individual technical and etude books, but I would say that all of them aim to practice general abilities or technical skills. However, practicing etudes in order to improve one\u2019s skills takes a lot of time. Then why don\u2019t I try to find the way to practice something particular from the piece what I practice? Everyone could actually be their own inspiration and inventor of exercises and approaches in the pieces that they are playing. Overall, this is an approach that I tried to develop during this research. \r\nIn this way, I think it would be absolutely more interesting and motivating during practicing. If I briefly illustrate this approach with a few examples, which will be discussed in more detail below, this would mean that, when I come up against something challenging in the piece, I start thinking how could I try to vary it to practice in different ways, such as register, interval, with and without tongue, slow and soft, with mouthpiece only, with slide movement and air flow only and so on. Rather than simply playing the same thing which wrote on the score. Based on this idea and motivation generally, I was wondering if I could integrate these ideas and try to sort out some practical approaches and give some motivation for the bass trombone players as an external inspiration to prepare the orchestral excerpts. During the research process, I also benefited from organizing, developing and adjusting my practice ideas. \r\nIn general, the main research idea is inspired by ideas of my former bass trombone teacher, Brandt Attema. He let me realize that not only we have to use time in more efficient way, but also, that we can always extract something from the piece, which we are struggling with or focusing on at the moment, and then invent the specific exercises that directly helps us to get used to the patterns in pieces.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the above, they are my original ideas to do this research: find out how to effectively prepare and practice the individual orchestral excerpts, and then sort out the inspiration into practical approaches. What\u2019s more, if people who receive my idea from my research in the future, I hope this would be a good materials and inspiration for them not only simply a method to practice, but also manage, or even master bass trombone orchestral excerpts with specific practice and strategies. Eventually, I wish each of us could reach some positive achievements by obtaining the inspiration that I am going to illustrate.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters, we will look into more details about how I try to deal with the orchestral excerpts with the ideas and approaches that I mixed from my teachers\u2019 points and my study experience. I hope through this research, my ideas could also inspire you in certain way that improves your practice in a different way which you don\u2019t really experience before. Furthermore, in later chapters, I will also demonstrate the results of the questionnaires that I inquired from several bass trombone players including students, teachers and orchestra musicians with their opinions. It is quite interesting to figure out what people\u2019s approaches and ideas are."}, {"id": 1545985, "type": "exposition", "title": "The evolution of women in orchestras", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1545985/1545986", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1545985", "keywords": [], "created": "20/02/2022", "last-modified": 1657530427, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "11/07/2022", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 1007075, "name": "Marie J\u00e9r\u00e9mie"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Western society is going through substantial changes regarding political, social and sexual inequalities.

The viola\u2019s rising status paved the way for collaborations between violists and composers, resulting in an expansion of a relatively limited repertoire and placing higher demands on the performer. Through theoretical and practical based research, I identify the roles and responsibilities of the classical violist when collaborating with living composers. At the centre of my practical investigations were collaborations with four composers in the realisation of new works and exploration of pre-existing works by three composers, as part of a cross-departmental/cross-cultural collaboration. These collaborations highlight the importance of a high level of musicianship and an ability to communicate with and without the instrument. Artistic and intellectual exchange through open communication results in mutually beneficial outcomes and a deeper connection with the music. Additionally, these collaborations reveal that the viola is still emerging as a solo instrument, needing further experimentation and exploration.\r\nThe final aspect of my research is the curation of a lecture-recital series showcasing these new compositions, anchored with works from the standard and lesser-known repertoire. The future aim is to perform and record these new works in order to reach a wider audience. Successful collaborations contribute to the generation, promotion, and contribution to the classical viola repertoire and the status of the instrument itself now and into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nBio\r\nMichelle Pritchard is an Australian violist, violinist and pedagogue, studying her Master in Classical Music (Viola) with \u00c1sd\u00eds Vald\u00edmarsdott\u00edr at The Royal Conservatoire, The Hague.\u00a0In Australia, Michelle studied with Alex Todicescu, Sydney Conservatorium.

To create enduring results regarding these matters, there needs to be a commitment to in-depth study of practices that will produce visible change. This is one of the goals of my research, in which I tackle issues of representation by focusing on Black women composers and their absence from the canon as overlooked and marginalized artists.  It is well known that women have been denied many opportunities throughout history; as composers, many experiences crucial to professionalism were not always available to women, including music education in composition, the publication and circulation of their works, not being hired as conductors, or receiving reviews from influential critics.  These opportunities and resources dwindled further if a woman was also a person of colour. Thus, in order to ensure their inclusion within the canon, these underrepresented identities demand and require unique recognition.\r\n\r\nI have examined the issue of neglected women of colour composers in classical music from an interdisciplinary standpoint, utilizing the methodologies of history and experimentation to form an \u201cintersectional feminist critical curation\u201d framework. This framework implements knowledge from intersectional feminist theory and music curation practices in order to answer following questions: \u201cWhat is the impact on new audiences of diverse backgrounds experiencing classical music through an intersectional feminist curatorial framework?\u201d, \"Can classical music be an effective device for messages of social and political change?\", and \u201cWhat is the impact on myself as a classical vocalist and a Black woman to implement an intersectional feminist curatorial framework within my musical study and performance?\u201d. The overall goal of this research was to discover an effective way forward to achieving diversity in classical music for underrepresented groups. Drawing from this study, I have created a digital performance project entitled \u201cThe Narrativity Sessions,\u201d which functioned as an experiment utilizing this knowledge of intersectional feminist theory and praxis fused with select critical curation strategies applied to my own artistic practice as a classical singer.

As far as the guitar as an instrument is concerned, in it the composer explores a great variety of innovative resources that verify its suitability to transmit the contents of contemporary music, while at the same time pays off the debt it had with Argentine folklore, present in its rhetoric and symbolically evoked, but now transfigured into a reality.\u00a0\r\nFinally, this research presents some connections between this guitar piece and the\u00a0String Quartet No. 1, op. 20, that Ginastera composed more than twenty years before.\u00a0"}, {"id": 1409514, "type": "exposition", "title": "No Joy in the Brilliance of Sunshine", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/ca/88/ec/17/ca88ec17fb0a51821d06d28a5e6229df.png?t=c872ae8f2d628919c06ea7befb282e3d&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1409514/1409515", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1409514", "keywords": ["multimedia", "performance", "baroque", "multidisciplinary", "George Frideric Handel", "Singing"], "created": "05/11/2021", "last-modified": 1652182200, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "10/05/2022", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 1047181, "name": "Sean Bell"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Sean Bell\r\nStudent number: 3230643\r\nMaster Early Music Voice\r\nResearch supervisor: Dr. In\u00eas de Avena Braga\r\nTitle: No Joy in the Brilliance of Sunshine\r\nResearch question: How can I create a stage performance combining and connecting my two sound worlds/style identities as a performer?\r\n\r\nSummary of the results of the research:\r\nIn this research I have explored the creative development of a stage performance, combining operatic music by Handel with contemporary performance art. Through this I have explored how I can combine my duality as a performer: the early music singer and the contemporary performer and creator. This project and its connected research are a part of my artistic development as a musician, creator and performer, and the urge to explore this music and questions grew out of previous projects and ideas.\r\nI have created and developed my project through following a consequential progression of artistic choices, and through this space that has unfolded I have come to find an essential identity of myself as a performer and creator. By being honest towards myself through the critical reflection, I have been able to investigate my process, my preferences, inspirations and my distinct personal style. Through this I have been able to strengthen my artistic identity and the artistic tools I use, bringing forth a more complete performer.\r\n\r\nShort biography:\r\nSean Bell is a countertenor and performance artist from Oslo. His studies centre mainly on chamber and sacred music and opera, yet also includes a focus on new ideas and methods of interpreting classical and contemporary repertoire. Through sonic imaginations and arrangements, he explores this repertoire in new ways. This has led him to a series of collaborations and solo performances on the border line between classical music and performance art. Bell also works with contemporary music and has premiered several pieces for countertenor. He is an active improviser, plays baroque guitar and engages in instrument building and music electronics."}, {"id": 1420396, "type": "exposition", "title": "\"An Actor Prepares\": A musician's approach to a selection of techniques by Konstantin Stanislavski", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/b2/54/2b/a6/b2542ba6dd80e4ebd0df0658edd3f99f.png?t=baba411b6cccc4c86d87dd204b329d6a&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1420396/1420397", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1420396", "keywords": ["piano", "Enoch Arden", "practice", "Musical Training Performance &amp; Cognition", "Music Performance", "emotions", "imagination", "Constantin Stanislavski", "Konstantin Stanislavski"], "created": "11/11/2021", "last-modified": 1652111100, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "09/05/2022", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 1009362, "name": "Andr\u00e9 Teixeira"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "The belief that imagination\u2019s engagement and emotional connection with what I play enhance my performance propelled me to do this research.

The study finds the vast majority of surviving chitarroni to have a stopped string length around 88-89cm, with some exceeding 90cm and very few falling short of 80cm. This sparks the question of whether smaller instruments required a different tuning. Upon comparing with lute family instruments from the same era, the logical conclusion is that smaller instruments with string lengths around 76cm most probably did not need to have a double re-entrant tuning which is the standard tuning for all solo chitarrone music. When comparing a large instrument (95cm) and a small instrument (76cm, with single re-entrant tuning), one can hear that they perform very different roles as continuo instruments, and are not mutually replaceable. As modern-day lutenists, one should really embrace the large size if one wishes to play the chitarrone, and develop a technique to suit the instrument, instead of scaling down the instrument to suit the technique. \r\n\r\n\r\nMenglin Gao has been a recorder player, a countertenor, and now a theorbist, studying at the Royal Conservatoire of the Hague.

Music wants to make us speak. That\u2019s what music says!\u2019\r\n\r\nThat raises the question whether music can be referential or carry meaning just as language can. A question that has made many speak and filled libraries of studies. Cognitive psychologist Aniruddh D. Patel writes in 2008: \u2018A natural place to turn for help in defining musical meaning is the work of music theorists and philosophers of aesthetics\u2019. After summing up a dozen publications on the topic since Webern made his statement, Patel reports: \u2018No consensus has emerged from these writings for a definition of musical meaning.\u2019\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of evidence in linguistics that qualities attributed to musicality contribute to language being the carrier of meaning. So what about the other way around? Can language help to understand what is experienced as meaningful in music?\r\n\r\nLanguage itself is an indicator that qualities inherent to language are often given to music. In German the word Interpret is used for instrumentalists performing music. The Dutch language has the word zeggingskracht that attributes power to music. 'Zegging-\u2019 stems from the verb zeggen (to say), \u2018kracht\u2019 means power. Zeggingskracht was one of the three criteria to assess the work of composers by the Fund for the Creation of Music (Fonds voor de Scheppende Toonkunst ) in The Netherlands. When the power to speak is inhibited and people stammer or lose their speech suffering from aphasia, it has been said that \u201conly music, can do the calling.\u201d And it\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 to say that music can express what can\u2019t be given words.\r\n\r\nMusic is not a language but often sounds like one. What do musicians that are \u2018speaking\u2019 that music have to say about meaning in music, singing, performing or creating what composer Louis Andriessen describes as \u2018talkative\u2019 music? Or the stammering that composer Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g calls his mother language? How do musicians give words to those moments when their music does the talking?\r\n\r\nWhat is the word is the last text that Samuel Beckett completed at the end of his life when through a stroke he periodically suffered from the disability to finds words, commonly diagnosed as aphasia. The Irish author inspired many to explore the zeggingskracht of music. Precise as he was, Beckett left out a question mark in the title, both in the original French version of Comment dire and in his English translation. That the title of Samuel Beckett\u2019s last text is not posing a question but may provide us with an answer, is the hypothesis of this research."}, {"id": 888692, "type": "exposition", "title": "Tales of the unexpected", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/888692/888693", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=888692", "keywords": [], "created": "15/05/2020", "last-modified": 1631704965, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "15/09/2021", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 221113, "name": "Hans Koolmees"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "this is the pdf version"}, {"id": 532883, "type": "exposition", "title": "Innovator, Influencer, Explorer: The Harpist-Composer-Teacher, 1800-1914", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/532883/762019", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=532883", "keywords": ["harpists", "innovator", "harp compositions", "19th century", "harp", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "16/11/2018", "last-modified": 1630499206, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "01/09/2021", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 532859, "name": "Ernestine Stoop"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Drawing upon key figures in the development of harp pedagogies, techniques and compositional practices in the long 19th century, how did developments in esteem, sound and construction of the harp pave the way for early 20th century composers and their harpist-protagonists? \r\nTo what extent did these harpist-composer-teachers influence composers like Debussy and Ravel, and how might they have inspired the next generation of harpists  (harpist-composers) to be innovators, influencers and explorers themselves?"}, {"id": 521282, "type": "exposition", "title": "Sigfrid Karg-Elert\u2019s Opus 153 for saxophone solo \u2013 \u201cThe saxophone\u2019s Cello Suites\u201d", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/521282/771436", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=521282", "keywords": ["saxophone", "karg-elert", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "19/10/2018", "last-modified": 1630498585, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "01/09/2021", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 521181, "name": "Raaf Hekkema"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Raaf Hekkema\r\n\r\nClassical Saxophone\r\n\r\nSupervisor: Anna Scott\r\n\r\nSigfrid Karg-Elert\u2019s Opus 153 for saxophone solo \u2013 \u201cThe saxophone\u2019s Cello Suites\u201d\r\n\r\nHow could I be the best advocate for the above-mentioned work and its composer?\r\n\r\nI have investigated how to become the best advocate for the above-mentioned work and its composer, since I think they deserve more attention.

Antonio Caldara needed to adapt to the imperial court music taste and also to its available instrumentarium, and from the day he started to compose for Charles VI, he began to use different instruments in his way of writing arias in his oratorios. In order to keep the focus of the research on his oratorios composed in Vienna, I purposefully will not discuss the considerable number of operas he composed in the same period, and I will contextualize these works thanks to a descriptive catalogue of each of the oratorios, to the translations of the texts of the arias, and by paying attention to the Habsburg dinasty in Vienna.\r\n\r\nShort biography\r\nMaud Haering is a French soprano.

Xavier Lef\u00e8vre (1763-1829) was one of the first clarinet professor to teach there, from 1795 to 1824. In 1802 he published an important clarinet tutor intended for study at the Conservatoire: M\u00e9thode de clarinette.  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Berr (1794-1838)  held the same position from 1832 to 1838. In 1836 he published a M\u00e9thode compl\u00e8te de clarinette and a Trait\u00e9 complet de la clarinette.\r\nThanks to these writings, it is possible nowadays to get an idea of the skills needed by a French clarinettist of the early 19th century to play the music of his time. The aim of this research is thus to describe the main aspects of performance practice during the chosen period. Many of these aspects are not limited to the clarinet. Consequently, other methods for singing or for other instruments related to the Conservatory, have been studied to provide a broader perspective of performance practice at that time. \r\nAs the first decades of the 19th century witnessed important developments in clarinet making and instrumental technique, it has been essential to discuss this point in this research. However the central aspect of this work is musical expression, the ultimate goal of a performance. Phrasing, the variety of articulation and dynamics appear as essential tools for the performer who wants to communicate with the audience. \r\n\r\nShort biography\r\n\r\nTh\u00e9o Couillez is a French clarinetist.

As an early music singer, I am attracted to the sweet and charming 17th-century French vocal music. In particular, I am interested in the relationship between French ornamentation and expression. This research investigates the background of 17th-century performance practice in France in relation to the ornamentation, the pronunciation of 17th-century French, the different types of ornaments and the expression implied by the ornaments. The performance practice in the 17th century was different from now since it was undergoing a major change from polyphonic to solo music, which emphasised more the text than the music. The knowledge of ornamentation was an expected requirement for all well-trained singers in the 17th century, ornamentation was not merely a decoration, but a tool in emphasizing the importance of the text. Thus, it is necessary to learn ornamentation for a complete 17th-century French vocal performance. Since text was the main element in 17th-century French vocal music, it is important to know the characteristics of French language in this period. The ability to distinguish French long and short syllables was important because ornamentation could only be applied mostly to long syllables. The pronunciation of certain French vowels has undergone a significant alteration, and the \u2018old\u2019 way of pronouncing them is included in the study. The research findings also show that some ornaments were meant to be used only in certain expression and they help me to better \u2018compose\u2019 French ornamentation in future performances."}, {"id": 1038501, "type": "exposition", "title": "Intabulation as process and practice (Master thesis)", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/0e/ac/8d/10/0eac8d1061cef7a551f0e37248c7ebd7.png?t=e36b33675b730aa4bb8aab138bf75c67&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1038501/1038502", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1038501", "keywords": ["Lute", "intabulation", "arrangement", "Renaissance", "polyphony", "Art of Interpretation"], "created": "05/11/2020", "last-modified": 1624026895, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "18/06/2021", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 710530, "name": "Asako Ueda"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Research Title:\r\nIntabulation as process and practice\r\n\r\nResearch questions:\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the manifold surviving solo lute intabulations from around 1500, where is the line between \"unwritten\" and \"written\" intabulation? \r\nIntabulating involves the writing out of several parts into tablature, but does this twofold distinction really apply to all pieces? \r\nWhat was the process of appropriation of vocal polyphony for a lutenist of the early 16th century?\r\nHow can we apply this to our own processes?\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nIntabulation refers to the arrangement of vocal pieces for what Johannes Tinctoris refers to as a \u201cperfect instrument\u201d, amongst which he counts such instruments as keyboards and the lute \u2013 and it implies writing out the parts of a polyphonic composition into tablature. However, after playing many surviving intabulations for several years, I had a strong feeling that there must be an \u201cunwritten\u201d solo lute intabulation practice behind the \u201cwritten\u201d intabulations from the beginning of the 16th century, in contrast to the more \u201ccomposed\u201d intabulations from the time after the mid-16th century. While surviving sources provide us with much information on what lutenists played, they also hide the \u201cunwritten\u201d practice which they did not record. We can only imagine what was happening. In this thesis, I investigate the process of intabulation by lute players from this time by analysing and comparing different versions of the same song from different sources. Through this research, I trace the transition of the changing style of intabulation, which is in turn related to the transition of lute technique from plectrum to finger-plucked and the change in style of the vocal models. Moreover, the diffusion of printed music changed the manner of the transmission of music. To conclude, I hypothesise that lute players might have listened to and copied each other\u2019s intabulations unconsciously, and when they wanted to preserve their work, they might have made some adjustments to their intabulations. The study also suggests how to apply these ideas to actual intabulation practice, which will be presented in the Research Symposium online as a video format.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nThe Japanese lutenist Asako Ueda studied the lute at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague with Mike Fentross and Joachim Held and completed her Bachelor's with the highest achievable mark, which gives her the opportunity to continue to the Master\u2019s program with the Excellence Scholarship of the Royal Conservatory of the Hague.

This expressiveness and freedom seems to a great degree to stem from a very different, more fluent, concept of musical time. In this research I wanted to understand these recordings better, to see what can be learned from them and how it can be applied in modern practice. I asked the question: how can analyses of recordings by Felix Weingartner, Willem Mengelberg and Pierre Monteux aid the use of 19th-century stylistic traits in modern orchestral performance practices? This research question was answered by first conducting detailed quantitative analysis on unnotated use of tempo flexibility and portamento on recordings made by these conductors. This was followed by an experimental practice-based phase where these findings were applied.\r\n  The most striking finding of my analyses is the ways in which all three conductors used un-notated tempo flexibility. Using the structuralist and rhetorical terminology of Nicholas Cook (2013), in slightly altered form, their interpretations all exhibit rhetorical tendencies, with Weingartner being the most structuralist, Mengelberg the most rhetorical, and Monteux somewhere in the middle.

The practice varies in name based on its context: in Italian and Spanish music it is called diminution, in English music it is called division, and in dance movements from French suites it is called a double. The question then remains: why do these theoretically identical practices remain distinct in name?  Are there other ways in which they differ?\r\n\r\nThis exposition argues that there are indeed other ways in which these different families of diminution-style ornaments differ, and for this purpose it examines texts and scores from each group. For diminutions, the focus was Silvestro Ganassi\u2019s \u201cOpera intitulata Fontegara\u201d (1535) and Diego Ortiz\u2019 \u201cTrattado de Glossas\u201d (1553); for divisions, Christopher Simpson\u2019s \u201cThe Division Viol\u201d (1659); and for doubles, Marin Marais books of \u201cPi\u00e8ces de viole\u201d (1686-1725). \r\n\r\nThe first chapter is an explanation of the chronological history of these different practices, beginning with diminution during the Italian Renaissance, moving to England in the mid-17th century, and ending with Marais\u2019 suites from the late-17th to early-18th centuries. The second chapter explains the contextual differences of each style (in which genre/musical setting it was applied). The third chapter explores stylistic elements that are unique to each style, and the fourth chapter discusses the implications this information has for the modern player of the viola da gamba."}, {"id": 1186099, "type": "exposition", "title": "Accessibility of Music Production Software for the Visually Impaired: A study of developing an eyes-free audio application for a surface haptic interface", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/55/90/ad/b6/5590adb6fb9ec7d4123c47da89573332.png?t=1f6decb5605cd4b7d3b517b653d90f27&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1186099/1186100", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1186099", "keywords": ["music production", "audio", "Accessibility", "Art of Sound"], "created": "08/03/2021", "last-modified": 1620033792, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "03/05/2021", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 702435, "name": "Jakub Pesek"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "In the past three decades, the process of music-making moved away from operating analogue devices to using the software running inside of computers.

This requires 3 basic needs: relation, competence and autonomy. As a teacher you are responsible for this. You also have the responsibility to take on the five roles of the teacher: host, presenter, didactic, pedagogue and concluder.  As a teacher you need to be able to set up a good lesson plan, such as the direct instruction model. Differentiation must be applied smartly. Finally, the first 6 weeks are the most important of the group formation, therefore my lesson program is based on 6 lessons. \r\n\r\nBy using a STARR reflection model, every lesson made and given has been reflected on a structural way.\r\n\r\nThe results were positive. By setting small but achievable goals, there was rest during the lessons and enough time to pay attention to the group process.

After practicing natural horn as a modern horn player, I became interested in developing an effective practical method to play natural horn and this led me to start my research on this topic. Through extensive interviews with modern horn players who also played natural horn and students who just began to learn natural horn, I was able to figure out the most difficult part in the learning process. Although both the modern horn and the natural horn use the same mouthpiece, it should be played with different musical techniques. In this thesis, I propose three effective ways, a breath attack, a lip bending and a hand-stopped technique, in which a modern horn player can practice to learn natural horn. These three techniques can be practiced and easily applied to, for example, Beethoven horn sonata, op.17.

The analysis is categorized into the evolution of the debutante piccolo, by observing its accomplishments by the following analysis of what the piccolo accomplished in that role: [1.] As an extender of range and dynamics; [2.] Programmatic effects achieved; [3.] Its inclusion in solo arrangements either within a movement or as the complete soloist; each of these concepts will be built into the Pre-, Beethoven and Post-Beethoven periods.  For this thesis, the Pre-Beethoven period ranges from the possibility of Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (1567 \u2013 1643) for \u2018Flautino,\u2019 written in 1607 to Mozart, including the military music of the French Revolution.

His middle and late period including a re-examination of his symphonic works related to the piccolo from this authors perspective including his symphonic works follows.

How can the \u2018slurred staccato\u2019 present in Leclair\u2019s works be interpreted? Who influenced him and who has he influenced?\r\nSummary of Results: The purpose of this paper is to focus on the \u2018slurred staccato\u2019 found in Jean-Marie Leclair's (1697-1764) works, from the perspective of style, character of movements, key, bow direction in actual performance, etc. \u2018Slurred staccato\u2019 is a sign notated as dots with a slur. This paper aims to clarify the effects of \u2018slurred staccato\u2019, and to look at how those \u2018slurred staccatos\u2019 can be interpreted in Leclair\u2019s works.  \r\n\u2018Slurred staccato\u2019 is the technique of playing two or more notes with one bow, separating each note shortly. It first appears in vocal music such as a trill or ornamental notes, then it gradually appears in instrumental music in the early 17th century. But at first it appears almost as a vibrato or tremolo, and is therefore a little different from \u2018slurred staccato\u2019, which developed especially as a violin-specific technique during the 18th century. This technique was first seen in the violin music late 17th-century Germany, but in France it is rarely seen before the generation of Leclair. Leclair was one of the earliest composers who used this technique in France in the early 18th century. In this period, this technique was found mainly in slow tempo movements, but Leclair uses it frequently in fast tempo. His virtuosity appears in this point. In conclusion, he pursues both the brilliant virtuosity and comfort of playing using advanced techniques, and \u2018slurred staccato\u2019 is one of them. His violin techniques and music has definitely influenced contemporaries and later composers and performers.\r\nBiography:Sakura Goto was born in Tokyo.

The most remarkable example that shows these aspects, is \u201cAphasia\u201d by Mark Applebaum. This piece was inspired by a conversation between a friend and Applebaum.\r\nThe point of this question is not about instructions or the piece itself but the relevance of this genre in the percussionist development and the percussion repertoire.

Research question: What does a saxophonist need to do to gain throat flexibility to accurately perform overtones, altissimo register, glissando, pianissimo dynamics in extreme ranges, large interval leaps and singing while playing?\r\n6. Summary of the results.\r\nThis research is a guide to show a way of practicing to increase saxophone player\u2019s throat flexibility. It is for students who are not able to control their throat when they play other saxophones which are not their main instrument. The specific skills dealt with in this paper are overtones, altissimo, glissando, singing while playing, large intervals and high and low registers with pianissimo dynamics, because all these techniques benefit from throat flexibility. Many people just study these techniques without understanding the principles. These principles are clearly described, and many exercises are given to develop the skills. Since it is required in most of these techniques to maintain throat flexibly, it is one of the most important areas of study. There are several method books and articles to help with this, but the methods are only focused on physical practice. This research attempts to present a way to practice with balance between mental and physical study.\r\n7.

In the 18th century Baroque period, the art improvising was quite common amongst musicians, as it was one of the standard performance practices of the time. Someone hearing the term \"improvisation\", might conjure an image of people with an extremely specialised skill, but actually the practise has continued throughout history and is still used often nowadays in many musical styles.\r\nThere are many kinds of improvisation: dances, freeform improvisation, such as Pr\u00e9lude non mesur\u00e9, Italian toccata and Fantasy; and ground- or ostinato-bass (e.g. La Monica, Passamezzo Antico, Passamezzo Moderno, Bergamasca, Romanesca, La Folia etc.)\r\nFor my research, I focused to the variation style because there are numerous written-out variation examples by prominent composers from which to learn. Because of these examples, we can clearly confirm variation ideas as every variation starts with a theme and afterwards, we clearly see the composer build their ideas up from start to finish. These ideas are very useful to inspire our own ideas, because with numerous possibilities in your head, you have more from which to choose and create, an improvising vocabulary.\r\nFinally, we can use all this vocabulary, the nuance of when to use it, as well as develop our own voices for our own improvisations.\r\nIn this research I introduce my process and how to connect all the tools for improvising variations in performance."}, {"id": 513505, "type": "exposition", "title": "Teaching jazz double bass in the 21st century", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/e7/c3/cf/a7/e7c3cfa73650803b8283ef977634778f.png?t=e1137760d985176004a1f340527f982f&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/513505/775091", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=513505", "keywords": ["jazz", "double bass", "education", "methods", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "02/10/2018", "last-modified": 1594572503, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "12/07/2020", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 342973, "name": "Tony Overwater"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "My initial plan was to do research and catalogue the available existing method books for Jazz bass education.

Researching this topic further, I learned that these experiences can be described as singing-related well-being. According to a growing number of studies amateur choir singing  produces various beneficial effects on health and well-being. Research on professional singers about their experiences and occupational well-being has been much scarcer. Based on the limited studies, they might not enjoy all of the same benefits of singing as amateurs do. The goal of this research was to start closing this research gap and to learn what professional choir singers have to say about singing-related well-being. I created an online questionnaire to gather experiences from professional singers, and also kept a diary of my own well-being experiences during professional choir projects. Analysing these two sources of data revealed that professional singers did recognise many of the well-being experiences associated with singing. However, professional choir singing was not perceived as something especially relaxing or therapeutic, which are common themes emerged from research on amateurs. The social aspects of choir work were deemed important in experiencing singing-related well-being, as well as the conductor\u2019s artistic approach. For me personally, these well-being experiences have been the motivation for my career choice and for this research, and they also serve as an indicator of my development as a musician. \r\n\r\nThe format of this research is a thesis.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nLaura Ginstr\u00f6m (1992) is a Finnish mezzo-soprano who has studied vocal pedagogy and clinical psychology in Helsinki.

This research provides historical and practical context to organ vespers by relating it to Jewish, Roman Catholic and Anglican traditions of Evening Prayer, and to how Dietrich Buxtehude entertained local businessmen in his series of Abendmusiken. It discusses relevant literature and the guidelines of the Dutch Protestant Service Book on prayers and music. Three practices of organ vespers in the Netherlands are compared.

Second, it describes the results of a questionnaire held amongst the visitors of those vespers. In total 82 questionnaires were filled in by those attending at least one of the vespers. Based on the results, this study argues that organ music in a liturgical context has the exquisite quality of engaging and interacting with listeners and participants in the liturgy.

However, it is a necessary part of the path leading to a fulfilling life as an orchestral musician.  The preparation for an audition certainly has specific aspects which need to be considered.  This paper discusses these aspects, based in large part on my experiences as a Principal in The Hague Philharmonic and as a committee member at auditions for many years.  As a violin and chamber music teacher as well as the teacher of the orchestral classes at the conservatoires in The Hague and Amsterdam, I have collected a wealth of experience training students to be successful at auditions. Besides the aspects of how to apply for an orchestral audition, which repertoire needs to be prepared, (including many orchestral excerpts which I have bowed and provided with fingerings myself), how to prepare effectively and what to expect on the actual audition day, there is a large section devoted to the research I have performed concerning mental and physical preparation. Developing mental skills to withstand the stress associated with auditions is an important part of audition preparation. Finally, I have researched, by means of a series of questions online and live and Skype interviews, how experts and candidates experience auditions.  This has put me in contact with leaders of orchestras from around the world.  How the two groups have responded to similar questions has put me in the position to draw some conclusions as to what committees expect at auditions and how this differs from the candidates\u2019 viewpoints.  In analyzing this research, and recognizing similarities in what I written from my own research and personal experience, I am able to draw some conclusions and make recommendations about how candidates could prepare better and be more successful at auditions.  \r\nBiography:\r\nJanet Krause is Principal Second Violinist in The Hague Philharmonic and also a violin, chamber music and orchestral studies teacher at The Royal Conservatoire in The Hague.

The term \"aleatoric\" music implies that chance determines how to fill the open spaces. The renewed approach in this research however aims to provide a score in which a performer as an improviser or co-composer is invited to shape the music according to his own opinion. The score provides a plan and context for improvised content and, in doing so, invites the performer to co-create the piece.\r\n\r\nThe research developed in three phases. In the first phase, improvisation was used as a learning tool in music theory classes. Different approaches to improvisation were studied and practiced. In the second phase, one group of musicians evolved from an improvisation course and went on a tour of five concerts. For them an open form score was created in order to provide context to the improvisations of the musicians. This composition is called View from a high mountain, a composition in six parts that allows improvisation at several moments. In the third phase, findings from the outcome and performance of View from a high mountain caused a renewal of the approach in the classroom. Through this renewal the boundary between education and musical production became a thinner line that allowed several cross-overs. Instead of a handbook containing a method or exercises or a new open form score The Improvisation Tree was created. The Improvisation Tree is a model that can be used as a help for creating, analyzing, categorizing and comparing open form scores."}, {"id": 102206, "type": "exposition", "title": "Historically Inspired Improvisation - Improvising on basis of 19th-century music making", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/102206/755106", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=102206", "keywords": ["Classical music", "improvisation", "music theory", "piano"], "created": "08/10/2014", "last-modified": 1575998049, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "10/12/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479586, "number": "2", "title": "Royal Conservatoire Investigations"}, "author": {"id": 33390, "name": "Bert Mooiman"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "The average modern classical musician, the performer of music from the common practice era, tends to perform from scores only, and to treat a score like a text that should be converted into sound as precisely as possible. This is usually a one way process: without a score there will be no music. As a result of this attitude the musical languages of the common practice period have become dead languages, more or less like Latin and Ancient Greek, which are (with very few exceptions) no longer spoken actively but only translated into modern languages. More and more musicians become aware of the artistic limitations of this approach. In order to become, like musicians from the past, creative performers who are able to enter into a living relationship with the music, learning how to improvise seems to be a valuable means.\r\nThe Royal Conservatoire in The Hague (The Netherlands) invests in \u2018classical\u2019 improvisation. An environment has been created which fosters the idea that improvisation is important for classical musicians, and a lot of experience has been gathered in teaching improvisation to those students. \r\nBut what precisely do we mean with the word improvisation? And how exactly do we argue that improvisation is important for the new generations of conservatoire students? Improvisation by classical musicians is often referred to as \u2018classical improvisation\u2019 or \u2018improvisation in a classical style\u2019. These terms are not without problems, though. I would like to propose the notion of \u2018historically inspired improvisation\u2019 instead, indicating improvisation which uses thorough knowledge about music making in the past as a source of inspiration. \u2018H.I.I.\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily aim for style imitations; rather, it works the other way around: integrating what we can use from historical music practices into our own creative music making. In this way, improvisation has the potential to fertilize all our \u2018musicking\u2019 (Chr. Small) \u2013 even when we play from scores. \r\nIn my essay, a recorded student improvisation will be taken as a starting point. I will analyse and comment upon this recording, developing the idea of musical \u2018loci communes\u2019 which enables us to connect improvisation with the interpretation of a score. It is interesting to compare such insights with original treatises on improvisation, especially Carl Czerny\u2019s Anleitung zum Fantasieren auf dem Pianoforte (1829). Czerny turns out to presume skills that are no longer self-evident to musicians of today, while on the other hand issues which are nowadays important are not addressed in his text at all. Drawing upon the theory of loci communes, I will work out an example of how I think Czerny\u2019s book can still be a valuable source of inspiration today."}, {"id": 297519, "type": "exposition", "title": "In search of new dimensions: pieces for   electronically processed double bass.", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/297519/297520", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=297519", "keywords": ["double bass", "electronics", "field recording"], "created": "20/09/2016", "last-modified": 1574337649, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "21/11/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 297457, "name": "Juli\u00e1n Sarmiento Escobar"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Juli\u00e1n Sarmiento\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Classical Double Bass\r\n\r\nResearch Supervisor: Karst de Jong\r\n\r\nTitle of Research: In search of new dimensions: Pieces for electronically enhanced Double Bass\r\n\r\nResearch Question: How can I develop an artistic product, which includes the electronically enhanced double bass and allows me to interact with topics relevant to today?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results: \r\nSince the start of this project, the goal was to discover and explore the paths of creative processes.

Just as Bart\u00f3k intended to introduce young musicians to his style, so did Berio attempt the same.  Berio's focus however, was on finding a more modern set of techniques and colors that the violin could create, and he used these pieces for children to illustrate his own ideas of theater and dramaturgy in music.  Because his ideas of theater consist of putting two completely different ideas together to make a third reality, the 1st and 2nd violin parts in his duets often sound as if they are in totally different worlds \u2013 with different dynamics, tone colors, and sometimes even tempi.  This results in a novel approach to chamber music in which each partner is equal, but also very independent of the other.  A beginning student can therefore contribute just as much musical value to a piece (indeed, sometimes much more) than a seasoned professional.  Since Berio doesn't specify the level or age that the student needs to be in order to play these pieces, this allows for a lot of freedom in the choice of performers.  The same piece can sound totally different if performed by two professionals, two young students, or one young student and one professional.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, each duet is dedicated to a friend, musician, or person that Berio admired, and can be likened to a musical portrait.  Berio said that the pieces were inspired by the \u201cfragile thread of daily occasions\u201d and therefore the pieces are not true portraits, but sometimes illustrations of an event which happened, a shared history between Berio and the dedicatee, or as in the case of Stravinsky, Bart\u00f3k, or Boulez, an homage to a piece composed by that composer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Duetti serve not only to introduce young musicians to Berio's style, but the full performance of the 34 duets is also a great introduction of 20th century musical concepts to audiences.  Since each duet is very short, there is much variety in a performance of the works, and since each duet focuses on one or two 20th century techniques while still staying in a very familiar tonal world, audiences can be challenged while still maintaining a handhold on familiar territory."}, {"id": 299071, "type": "exposition", "title": "Performers acoustics", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/299071/416798", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=299071", "keywords": [], "created": "20/09/2016", "last-modified": 1571663508, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "21/10/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 299065, "name": "Rogier Tamminga"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Rogier Tamminga\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Classical Cello\r\n\r\nResearch Supervisor: Patrick van Deurzen\r\n\r\nTitle of Research: Performer's Acoustics\r\n\r\nResearch Question: How can you manage, as a performer, to get optimal room or hall acoustics in a given situation?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results: \r\nAcoustics have been an integral part of music ever since its first existance.

One of the pioneering methods, written 30 years ago, 'Bass is Best' by Caroline Emery relies on parental help for the children\u2019s practice. My aim was to develop a method that children could use by themselves. Building on my practical experience of teaching children in Spain, using 'El Sistema', I developed and applied a teaching system over the last two years that incorporated this principal. Two of my pupils, using my system, within only three years of playing the double bass were able to play professional level orchestral excerpts. Therefore it is possible to combine technical discipline with creativity and enjoyment playing the instrument. This method is simultaneously a guide for teachers to promote a healthy attitude when creating a musical career both with and without the instrument. However, the role of the double bass teacher is fundamental. The teacher has to have passion, be able to explain the concepts of playing clearly and be able to help the child understand technique without creating pressure. One of the examples in my case study is when the child opens the book to practice after the lesson and he/she cannot remember the theory of the new concepts. My method helps to the student how to overcome a problem by themselves. I created a warm up programme to be used before playing the instrument, which helps to prevent strain and injuries. This also helps body awareness when playing the bass. Practicing these exercises before and after playing ensures that the muscle tissue is warm and elastic, the nerve impulses are faster and the joint fluid flows faster. This means that there is less chance of suffering an injury when playing the instrument.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nAdriana Gutierrez Salda\u00f1a was born in Salamanca (Spain) in 1994 and began playing the double bass at the age of eight. Five years later, she joined the bass section in youth orchestras making international tours to the present day. She started her bachelor focusing on classical double bass at the Conservatory of Castilla y Leon (Spain) with Joaquin Clemente. She was the first student to receive an Erasmus scholarship from Salamanca to study at the Guildhall School Music and Drama (UK) with Colin Paris and Luis Cabrera. During her bachelor she started teaching beginners on the double bass, was one of the coaches at the Youth Orchestra of Cantabria (Spain), was a volunteer at a \u201cminor centre\u201d and in an orphanage as a teacher in integration programmes."}, {"id": 481188, "type": "exposition", "title": "Bach and Numbers: Analysis of His Church Cantatas through Biblical Numerology", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/481188/589827", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=481188", "keywords": [], "created": "18/06/2018", "last-modified": 1571661753, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "21/10/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 399277, "name": "Min-ho Jeong"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Many years of singing religious texts, especially that of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750), as a counter tenor made me question if there were other methods of interpreting Bach\u2019s music beyond focusing only on musical affects or harmonies. Among the many interpretative methods, I became interested in biblical numerology, interpreting numerical values with religious symbolisms, and was motivated to research the relationship between biblical and musical numeric symbolisms in Bach\u2019s church cantatas. As many of his writings show, Bach\u2019s music is deeply rooted in the Lutheran faith and Protestant traditions and, a detailed biblical approach would serve as one of the many good ways for the performer to deepen his or her understanding of Bach\u2019s music and to enrich the interpretation in performance. The discovery of numeric insights in Bach\u2019s church cantatas helped me better understand and interpret his emotional expressions and depth of faith. I believe this knowledge will be useful for other performers in making a musical interpretation more compelling and communicative. \r\nThe objective of this research exposition is to suggest biblical numerology as a method to analyze and understand J.S. Bach\u2019s church cantatas and to reveal Bach\u2019s theological intentions by analyzing the correlation between the biblical and musical numeric values found in his solo cantatas for alto (BWV 82, 169) and how they apply in our understanding of the biblical symbolism in the text and the music."}, {"id": 301714, "type": "exposition", "title": "Jarz\u0119bski's Divisions", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/301714/301715/50/50", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=301714", "keywords": [], "created": "20/09/2016", "last-modified": 1571660467, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "21/10/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 301684, "name": "Matthijs van der Moolen"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Matthijs van der Moolen\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Baroque Trombone\r\n\r\nResearch Supervisor: Susan Williams\r\n\r\nTitle of Research: Jarz\u0119bski\u2019s Divisions - a transition from vocal to instrumental\r\nwriting for the trombone\r\n\r\nResearch Question: How are the diminution pieces by Adam Jarz\u0119bski showing a\r\ntransformation from vocal to instrumental writing for the trombone?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe aim of this research was to show how the 'diminution pieces' from Adam Jarz\u0119bski's\r\nCanzoni e Concerti (1627) illustrate a transformation from vocal to instrumental writing for the trombone. Those nine pieces are very different from other works in the same time and period, and combine two very different genres: diminution/division pieces, and canzoni/sonate. In the first chapters of this research, I will give a general idea about the music practices in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. I will also zoom in on the early trombones, and their use in different settings. After this background information, I made an analysis of Jarz\u0119bski's collection Canzoni e Concerti. Most attention went to the analysis of the 'diminution pieces' that are based on well-known motets from the sixteenth century. Based on this analysis, I finally give several suggestions for the performance of these compositions, for example, about the choice of instruments, the (basso continuo) accompaniment, and the tuning and pitch. My conclusion is that the 'diminution pieces' in Canzoni e Concerti show a clear transition from vocal to instrumental writing. Because they are so obviously written like earlier diminution pieces, they should in my opinion also be played like that.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nMatthijs van der Moolen (The Netherlands, 1994) studies historical trombone (master) with Charles Toet.

With this in mind the final result of this study is an arrangement of a famous Thai folksong for classical guitar duo. To have a result that justifies the nature of this music with all of its qualities I needed to research the characteristics of this music, the instruments used as well as the purpose and social context.\u00a0A challenge was the translating from the sound of the various original instruments to one instrument, the classical guitar. For this, I used the classical techniques but had to find also some unorthodoxy solutions to capture the spirit of my land of birth. As a result of my findings, I plan to conduct a new research study in order to appropriately and internationally promote the Thai folk music.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBiography:\r\nWorrapat started playing the guitar when he was nine years old. His first teacher was Samai Tosoongnern. In 2007 he studied electric guitar with Panom Krahan and two years later also with Anucha Patanaratanamole. In 2010 he studied classical guitar with Leon Koudelak at College of Music, Mahidol University. Currently, he studies with Zoran Dukic at Koninklijk Conservatorium (Royal Conservatory) in the Netherlands. Still, he enjoys spending too much time with the electric guitar and enjoys singing in a death metal band.\r\n\r\nWorrapat has won many prizes such as:\u00a0\r\n1st prizes at the Thailand International Guitar Festival 2015, the Asia International Guitar Festival 2015, the TGS Guitar Competition 2015, the Pattaya International Guitar Festival 2014 and many more international awards.\u00a0"}, {"id": 530080, "type": "exposition", "title": "Identity, Interaction and Joy of Playing.

Providing that there is a strong integration of the body as the source of the core rhythm (groove) with the voice as the source of the sound, I found that a vocalist could achieve rhythmic freedom and spontaneity in performance in a relatively short period of time. Playing small percussion instruments such as shaker, guiro or cowbell also proved very helpful in developing rhythmic awareness, and moreover, when used on stage they create an additional texture in the sound of the whole band. Bigger instruments such as handpan, congas and djembe, demand more physical engagement, and might affect the fluency of the vocal lines and one's concentration on the main instrument. Practising these can take a lot more time, as they require a high level of fitness, and should be a conscious choice\u2014a choice thus recommended only for vocalists who are aware of these demands."}, {"id": 318934, "type": "exposition", "title": "The road to freedom: Thinking in activity ,  Music and Alexander Technique", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/05/b8/fa/db/05b8fadbfbf52a7361c069885b15baeb.png?t=c10c8854a114f33fa9f8ae91b6311979&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/318934/468482", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=318934", "keywords": ["Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "12/12/2016", "last-modified": 1569497623, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "26/09/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 299425, "name": "Larissa Groeneveld"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Larissa Groeneveld\r\nMain Subject: Cello\r\nResearch Supervisors: Anna Scott & Stephan van Dijk\r\nTitle of Research:  The road to freedom: Thinking in activity\r\nMy Research Question: How can I make a connection between the core principles of AT and my own playing and teaching activities at the Royal Conservatoire The Hague ?\r\nThe goal of this research project was to create a connection between the core principles of Alexander Technique (AT) and my musical practice and teaching. This was motivated by my interest and struggle to integrate this technique into my life. In order to do this, I first visited and talked with a vast number of AT teachers who are already working on this combination, I read many key books written in the field, took AT lessons on a regular basis, and clarified and reflected upon my ideas by making video recordings of my teaching activities. Finally, I came up with a series of concrete methods and exercises for applying the core principles of AT in musical contexts. I have also made a series of short videos that demonstrate some of these ideas. In doing all of this I realized what a challenge it is to remain healthy and open in an on-going process of development, especially with all the difficulties we encounter in modern life. These issues are urgent and should be taken seriously. I am now even more convinced that we can only find solutions if we \u2018inhibit and direct.'

From a young age I was exposed to lots of music in and outside the house. I went out with my family to see my dad perform in the local bigband, concertband and funkbands. When I reached the age of 9 I started picking up the clarinet. This was my first proper music education. 7 years later i picked up the tenor saxophone and that's when I start to listen and play my first jazz standards. By the time I wanted to study at a conservatoire, I couldn't deny my love for the drums, having played the instrument since the age of 6. I started my studies at ArtEZ Zwolle, school of arts on drums in the course Jazz&Pop. In the meantime I devoloped myself in a performing artist & part time teacher. After the bachelors in Zwolle, I started the Masters program in the Royal Conservatoire, the Hague"}, {"id": 582291, "type": "exposition", "title": "A Universal Language? - Challenges of crossover music-making", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/582291/582292", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=582291", "keywords": ["Crossover", "Conducting", "Orchestra"], "created": "01/03/2019", "last-modified": 1569329303, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "24/09/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 411147, "name": "Tom Goff"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "This research project explores the process of collaboration between musicians of classical training on orchestral instruments, and musicians working in the pop, jazz and folk genres.

My musical activities span different genres within the jazz, classical, and pop worlds as a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and composer/arranger. As a conductor it was natural for me to investigate the artistic possibilities and practical limitations of projects where these worlds meet. I did this primarily through interviews with six musicians from various backgrounds: Joe Duddell, Frank Veenstra, Clark Rundell, Tim Kliphuis, Bart Schneemann, and Rob Moose. These interviews are supplemented by secondary literature that is primarily focused on the differences in training of classical and jazz artists. Whilst reflecting on the challenges that crossover projects present, I began to question what those challenges say about the differences between these musical cultures. The research also includes reflections on my recent experience conducting parts of Mark-Antony Turnage\u2019s Blood on the Floor with the Noord Nederlands Orkest.

As a result, many musicians, including myself, are not aware of the importance of developing a healthy technique and adopting injury-prevention habits. After many years of wrong technical approaches and constant physical tension when performing, I developed one of the most serious injuries existing, focal dystonia. The search for information about my own injury allowed me to discover the work of Dorothy Taubman. For several decades, this American pedagogue developed a piano method of her own that, apart from analyzing the biomechanical principles behind virtuosity, has obvious therapeutic effects on instrumentalists affected by injuries, including those of a serious nature like mine. Through this work, I expose the basic principles of this method and experiment with them in order to check if they have beneficial effects for my injury. My main conclusion is that, despite the fact that science considers focal dystonia incurable and irreversible, the application of healthy technical principles that take into account the biomechanical aspect of piano performing, can undoubtedly help to overcome this injury."}, {"id": 410039, "type": "exposition", "title": "Are my hands able to speak as well as my mouth?

And practice it?\r\n\r\nSummary of result:\r\nToday, Nomos Alpha (1965-66) is greeted with loud applause each time it is performed. And the piece is considered one of the greatest pieces of the 20th century's cello solo repertoire, still it's also one of most difficult and \u201cavant-gardiste\u201d. Furthermore, the piece remains 'Difficult' for the listener: it is submerged in the torrent of 144 micro-events, an extreme fragmentation accentuated by the presence of many silences. That's why Nomos is only rarely played. Since the piece's creation in 1966, lot of cellists were aware of the existence of Nomos Alpha. Many cellists had the score, but hardly anyone played it. \r\n It seemed important to me to begin my research with an analysis of the piece and an explanation of the historical musical context of that time. Indeed,  Nomos alpha  is one of Xenakis\u2019s most \u2018formalised\u2019 pieces, the structure and all the parameters are calculated down to the last details. For cellists, these knowledges are essential to understanding the piece and making the necessary choices to build its interpretation of Nomos Alpha. In last the last part of this research, I have maked a guide for performers  for the cellist who would like to play Nomos Alpha. For this guide I will try to concentrate on  some essentials  aspects of the piece for the performers. To illustrate this guide I did an critic comparative analysis of the different versions of the piece. And finally to complete this guide I did some videos of tutorials on how to practice the piece. \r\n\r\nBiography\u00a0\r\n After completing his studies at P\u00f4le Sup\u00e9rieur Paris Boulogne-Billancourt in Michel Strauss's cello class, as well as his Bachelor's degree in Musicology at Paris-Sorbonne University, Josquin Buvat continued his studies in a Master's degree in Performance at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Den Haag.

As a tutti player I noticed that there are a lot of different leaders. Some leaders moved a lot while playing, others almost didn\u2019t move. Some showed a lot of entrances, others almost none. Some gave a lot of remarks during the rehearsals and others didn\u2019t say anything. Some of them where open to suggestions from the group, others only wanted to do it their way. When I was leader myself, I sometimes didn\u2019t feel very secure because I didn\u2019t know what exactly was my role. I took this research as an opportunity to found this out.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I did literature research, and soon I realized that not so many people wrote about this subject. Next to the few articles I read about sectional leaders in orchestra, I studied some articles about leadership in general and I tried to apply the results I found in those articles on my specific subject: leadership in orchestra.\r\n\r\nSecond, I made interviews with conductors, tutti cellists and solo cellists from different orchestras and asked them about their opinion on a lot of things. For example, about the tasks of a principal, the way a principal should communicate with their section, other leaders and the conductor, and the way a principal cellist should be giving remarks to the section. As a result, I got a clear overview of the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of a principal cellist.\r\n\r\n                                                                                                               Biography\r\n\r\nLiesbeth (1995) studies with Michel Strauss and Jan-Ype Nota at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague.

Nowadays however, it is not so easy to find a decent harmonium, let alone to come across somebody who masters its specific technique and for that reason, harmonium pieces are these days often performed on an accordion. This research will therefore try to be a guide for the accordion player who is asked to play a piece that was originally written for the harmonium, by providing him with some necessary tools and background information concerning the specifics of the harmonium. First of all, a brief history, focussing on the historical and constructional similarities and differences between both instruments, is included and besides that, the most common harmonium-types (compression system, suction system, art harmonium) aswel as the rise of the free-bass accordions are being described. The second chapter deals with the specific repertoire for the harmonium by offering a list containing the majority of the romantic literature for the instrument, written by established composers of that era.

How then can the artist communicate an Emily Dickinson poem in a song in a way that an audience grasps the meaning the first time? For that reason, you need to define who you are on stage and what you want to communicate. But what do you communicate on stage when your first sentence is 'I'm Nobody!'? This research turns Nobodies into Somebodies and the other way around by looking at the voices (the characters) that are present in the poems of Emily Dickinson, specifically the poem 'I'm Nobody!'. Who speaks to whom? The research makes a journey from Emily Dickinson to scholars who write about her, composers who make songs on her poems and in the end to the performer who with all these people in her mind communicates the poem and the song to the audience. Finally, the voices in the poem become defined as various characters that can be performed on different settings of 'I'm Nobody!' by Ernst Bacon, Nick Raspa and Lori Laitman. From something vague and ungraspable the poem and its voices become very concrete and close to our own daily lives.\r\n\r\nShort Bio\r\nMezzo soprano Boukje started singing as soon as she could speak.

By looking at (historical) sources about the composer and the piece, and by analyzing the score we got an impression of the context and atmosphere of the quintet, and we created a story to go with it. We found that the piece fitted today\u2019s very important topic about finding your identity within the (mass) society, knowing the history of Shostakovich\u2019 own struggles and the expressions he creates in his melodies, harmonies, instrumentation etc.: sometimes searching, sometimes dragged along in sarcastic happiness and sometimes screaming for help. All these elements we used to conduct the research process, which included translation of the story lines and expressions into movements, words, light effects and different stagings.

However, when it comes to the interpretation of his lamentations (lamenti) and love letters (lettere amorose), one asks themselves whether it should perhaps be done in a more declamative way.

What created this experience? What roles did both audience and performers play? How did it differ from the ways in which we encounter classical music concerts in the 21st century? This research explores how 18th-century English music was publicly experienced in paid, secular concert settings. It was quite different from what we might now expect in the same setting, and therefore it engendered a vastly different performer-audience relationship than what we often have today. The concert spaces, audience makeup, and concert etiquette each were contributing factors in creating a varied and highly social experience for concertgoers. The aim of this research paper is to illuminate this experience and explore how something similar might be relevantly created in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nShort Bio\r\nChloe Prendergast is a violinist originally from Denver, Colorado.

In order to better understand how to perform rhetorically in an historically informed manner, an understanding of declamation as it was understood in the late 18th century is key. This thesis uses the written methods of English actor-turned-elocutionist, John Walker, as the basis to proposing a rhetorical approach to late 18th century solo keyboard repertoire. Linguistic concepts of sense, structure, style, and delivery (acting) are likened to analogous concepts in galant music and supported with statements from musical treatises and examples from musical works. Two main performance case studies are considered for comparison: the first linguistic, being Walker\u2019s 1787 annotated version of Edward IV\u2019s speech from William Shakespeare\u2019s \"Richard III\"; and the second musical, being the Adagio movement of Joseph Haydn\u2019s 1794 Keyboard Sonata Hob. XVI:52. It is hoped that this investigation will not only expand the horizons of the author\u2019s solo performances, but will also provide interesting and useful tools for other musicians.\r\n\r\nShort Bio\r\nAnders Muskens began modern piano studies at the age of 4 in Edmonton, Canada.

For two reasons this question seems relevant: 1. In the past century, the idea that musical performance should be an exact reproduction of the score has become increasingly predominant and in consequence the idea of exact synchronity has evolved. Seeking for a more creative and less reproducing way to perform, breaking up this rigid synchronity provides us with an exciting \"playground\" yet to be explored. 2. Particularly on the classical guitar arpeggiation can frequently be heard \u2013 often for more technical than musical reasons. Especially on this instrument, a more reflected use is desirable. It was barely looked at the rules on what happens \"inside\" an arpeggiation. A reason for that might be, that everything inside an arpeggiation usually occurs very rapidly which makes it a lot harder to be analyzed. Besides that, often in arpeggiation the performer relies on \"automatic\" processes that are difficult to be modified consciously. I propose the idea, that arpeggiation consists of multiple layers of meaning that can be put together in any possible combination. The layers of arpeggiation span with increasing subtlety from habitual arpeggiation to a meticulously planned effect. In the presentation I will demonstrate this concept by showing different ways and meanings of arpeggiation in recordings and on my instrument.\r\n\r\nShort Bio\r\nNiels Pfeffer finished his harpsichord studies at the Stuttgart University of Music under J\u00f6rg Halubek and his guitar studies with Johannes Monno in 2017.

In conservatories and music schools often an attitude towards classical music is developed from a narrower point of view: learning and performing a score. There are extra classes in solfeggio, harmony, improvisation, analysis and counterpoint. However, the reality is that, for most students these subjects are not connected to their practice as instrumentalists. As a pianist, I don\u2019t use all the resources I have as a theorist, and there seems to be a separation between these two practices. Might there be a different way to start practicing a classical work? For the purposes of my research I have chosen one piece as a case study: the first movement of Beethoven's piano sonata n. 31 (op. 110, in A flat major). First I analysed the movement and then I looked at what I can do with the data generated from the analysis. I developed some exercises in order to prepare one for studying the actual work. These exercises could bring theoretical knowledge and improvisation skills into the instrumental lessons and give the player a deeper insight into Beethoven\u2019s harmonic language and use of formal structures. Further research is necessary in order to work out these exercises for more repertoire of all levels, styles and even instruments. It is my intention with this research and future work to bring music theory and activities in the practice rooms of musicians closer together. \r\nBiography \r\nPim Witvrouw began his professional music studies at the Young Talent Department of the Lemmensinstituut in Leuven (Belgium) where he studied piano with Stefan Celen.

This research focuses on developing a much more conscious process in which I would know and understand where my musical ideas are coming from. To do this, I used a practice design utilising the six-step process of borrowing ideas from David Kord Murray's Borrowing Brilliance. Prior to the study, I interviewed three horn teachers from the Royal Conservatoire to compare how the musical ideas that these teachers use are formed. I compared their processes of approaching repertoire with the processes described in Murray\u2019s book. I also analysed four (contrasting) recordings of the concerto, noting details of how they were played \u2013 also with audio editing software.\r\nThe analysis of the teachers' responses showed that some of the \u2018six steps to borrowing ideas\u2019 featured. In this study, I used principles of the six-step process to design an exercise regime to help me practice Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 4. I used practice notes (logbook) to record the process and analyse the results. \r\nAs a result, the conscious exercises (in six stages), compared to my earlier way of practicing, enabled more planned execution and showed that a more systematic and efficient interpretation of the work was possible. Going through the \u2018six-step processes\u2019 and repeating them enabled new insights and improved interpretation of repertoire. This process is summarised in the form of endless algorithms.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nHorn player Seungjin Kang was born in South Korea where he began his musical studies with Seok-jun Lee and Kyung-il Choi.

Through the methods of content analysis I have found which topics were discussed and considered important from mid-18th century to mid-19th century. These topics were then systematized and placed in tables, compared and placed in one common table. Then scores were marked as close as possible to L. Mozart\u2019s intentions, L. Spohr\u2019s intentions and the score I used before  (marked before my research).  After that, these were practiced and recorded.\r\n\r\nComparing the scores has brought me to some conclusions, differences between my playing and the requests of the masters. These were all the basic features of the classical style, which can be applied to my interpretation in theory. With the practicing and recording methods, I could choose more objectively which features of classical style, which I shall apply to my interpretation (the ones listed as an answer to the third sub-question).\r\nTheoretically speaking, regarding the tempo \u2013 I have always practiced perfect tempo keeping with the metronome and never even considered the fact of slowing down, let alone accelerating in furious passages.\r\nThe dynamics marked in my score are similar to what is in L. Mozart and L. Spohr versions. I had never accentuated first of the slurred notes and then made a diminuendo, as L. Mozart asks. One difference, however, was in the dolce section in which   I used to play a quasi- polyphonic setting in which both piano and forte was used. Mozart and Spohr would play dolce in a soft, ingratiating.\r\nThe bowings in my version are more versatile and in a way continue L. Spohr\u2019s tradition of slowly leaving behind the down beat down bow tradition so present in L. Mozart\u2019s Versuch. Regarding the usage of my bow, through Spohr\u2019s Violinschule I have rediscovered the upper half of the bow. For instance,  I always played the detasche  bowing in the middle part of the bow, unlike Spohr suggests (upper third).\r\nMy fingerings version was almost the same as the L. Spohr\u2019s version and quite different from L. Mozart\u2019s version. Being able to use the open string and flageolets is truly helpful. Though, according to some, the usage of the harmonics when playing orchestra  auditions with this concerto should be somewhat  limited. (Kugel, 2014)\r\nBefore analyzing the two violin schools,  I have used different ornamentation,  which was marked in my score. (Hoffmeister F. A., 1996) For example in bar 41 Music Well edition that I was using asks for a trill, while Henle edition only marks a turn. Also, it has before never occurred to me to even consider adding some embellishments  myself. After reading L. Mozart\u2019s Versuch, I am much more confident to add the embellishments, as well as to treat the vibrato (tremolo) as an embellishment, which should be added only on long notes. Practically speaking, I have made different choices for my interpretation.  This new interpretation is a mixture of both violin methods and it represents the classical features that I shall apply to the performance practice because of their musical consequences.19\r\n\r\nI have often found it somewhat hard to understand what exactly the classical style is. But, in my opinion, with such little improvements as mentioned earlier in this section, one can get closer to the style. As we know, playing in a correct style has gained more and more importance in the last century (Scherman, n.d.), and the audition setting asks for it as well. (Lebrecht, 2014)\r\nWhat still should be done to improve the clarity of the research is to apply the topics that I have extracted in the tables on the whole concerto. Also, there is definitely room for improvement in the embellishments section. In my research, there was no place for a thorough study of all embellishments that L. Mozart had stated.  Such study and its application on the whole of Hoffmeister concerto would be of great importance to its understanding.  Also, a study of the difference between the L. Mozart\u2019s Versuch and L.\r\nSpohr\u2019s Violinschule could bring great insight to how violin technique changed from mid-18th century to mid-19th century. I consider my common table as a good beginning of the study. To conclude, I hope my research will bring some clarity to the young colleagues who wish to have more information on the Hoffmeister Viola Concerto, as it did for me. Especially I wish it to be a guide for putting down bowings, choosing fingerings, adding and performing\r\nembellishments.

Bach's Orchestral suite no.2 on 16 foot Violone?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nAlthough all string players are interested in the problems of bowing, it remains a major point of discussion at rehearsals and takes up a lot of time. More often than not there is not enough time, short-cuts are taken, and the bowings are just a standard imposed on the music for ease of rehearsal.\r\nA phrase can be played differently with the same bowing directions or sound the same with different bowings. To be able to play a phrase the way I would like it should I practice until satisfied or change the bowings? Due to the lack of information on bowing directions of 16 foot Violone in the 18th century I have looked to visit treatises of the 18th century that contain information on bowing directions of the violin. This piece has been chosen in particular because much thematic material of the violins also occurs in the basso, enabling the possibility of comparing similarities and differences.

The humanist theme, that inspired not only musicians but also poets, painters and architects of the time, into a common goal; the expression of the human emotions.\r\nThe research \u201cArchitecture of emotions\u201d, is centred in Monteverdi\u2019s music in the period starting from his Lamento d\u2019 Arianna (1608) to the Lamento della Ninfa included in the Eight Book of Madrigals (1638) - the same time, thirty years, that it takes Francesco Borromini to finish the small church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome, in what will be his first (the interior) and his last commission (the fa\u00e7ade). \r\nInspired in this extraordinary building, which is both a guide and structure to the musical ideas presented, and supported by a selection of Caravaggio\u2019s paintings to be the visual counterpart to Monteverdi\u2019s music, this research aims to be a possible and personal interpretation to the vast question of the relation between music, painting and architecture in the context of the humanist environment in the transition from Renaissance to Baroque in Italy.\r\n \r\nBiography:\r\nAfter working as an architect for several years, the Portuguese Soprano Anabela Marcos, was granted a full scholarship from the Gulbenkian Foundation of Lisbon to study Singing and Opera at the Royal Conservatoire in the Hague, the Netherlands, with Rita Dams, Diane Forlano and Marius van Altena. \r\nHer opera repertoire includes Pamina (Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, Mozart), Suzanna (Le Nozze de Figaro, Mozart), Zerlina (Don Giovanni, Mozart), Titania (Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Britten), Clori (L\u2019Egisto, Cavalli), Venus and Cupid (King Arthur, Purcell), Daphne (Apollo and Daphne, H\u00e4ndel), Belinda (Dido and Aeneas, Purcell).\r\nAs a soloist, Anabela has worked with conductors such as Ton Koopman, Jos van Veldhoven, Sigiswald Kuyken, Michel Corboz and she is a member of the Baroque ensemble La Primavera.

One issue that is recently placed on the agenda of lutenists is the plucking technique applied on lutes. It is a known fact that Thumb-out was the technique applied most commonly for lute playing. Yet, very few lutenists adopt this Thumb-out technique today. Modern lute tutors tend to advise to avoid Thumb-out. If not, they advise to pluck around the rossete, and position their thumb close to the index finger. In paintings and treatises, however, we see Thumb-out hand with thumb positioned away from the index while the hand is placed around the bridge, and Thumb-out hand placed around the rosette, the former more often. I delved into this technique for 3 years and have come to understand that this \u201cforgotten Thumb-out\u201d is as matter of fact a technique that can be very beneficial for lute players, opening new, colorful, historical and healthy possibilities.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nThe American-Korean lutenist, Talitha Cumi Witmer, started her musical studies at age 4 with church choir and piano.

In a country with an important tradition of wind band musical practice, it seems strange that so few women composers have used this medium to convey their musical ideas. In order to put the production of female composers for this medium in perspective, I researched relevant works from as many European female composers as possible. Ultimately, the hope was to better understand their outputs for wind band, to promote their works, and to make way for a new composition for wind band from a female Portuguese composer.\r\nThis project has three main outcomes: 1) an online and physical catalogue of virtually all European female composers who have written for wind ensemble, including biographical data, a list of their works, and statistical analyses of their personal data (by age, country, type of ensemble); 2) a critical edition of Berta Alves de Sousa's Porto Her\u00f3ico manuscript; and 3) my commissioned work for wind band O Soldado da Misarela by Anne Victorino d\u2019Almeida.

Modern bow vs. baroque bow: comparisons and inspirations\r\n\r\nResearch Questions: To what extent do the shape and construction of the bow affect the violinist\u2019s sound and to what extent do her/his use of the bow and musical choices influence the sound? What can a modern violinist learn from experimenting with a baroque bow? What are aspects of the evolution of the violin bow, its use and the evolution of right hand technique from the 18th century until now that are essential to be aware of when playing with both modern and baroque bow?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe bow is the soul of the violin. Playing with different bows alters our sound. Their shape and construction affect the articulation that we naturally get with them. This fact tells us a lot about the music for which they were built, and we can learn from it in a natural way. But when a violinist is only familiarised with a modern bow, the learning process with an old bow can hardly take place. It is better to know what the characteristics of each bow are and experimenting with them in order to get used to them. After having this experience, different attacks, articulations and nuances will emerge and facilitate the music for which every bow was thought. It is interesting to see how the sources from those times show us the musical value of the different possibilities of the old bow. Nevertheless, if the musical idea the violinist has in mind does not match the old bow\u2019s natural behavior and the indications made for its use, using it would not bring any advantage. After an overview of the evolution of the bow and its relation with the right hand technique, I will explore the possibility of combining a modern instrument with an old bow as well as the benefits of using it for playing, especially when used following the indications the sources of that period reveal.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nBorn in Santiago de Compostela, she finished her bachelor\u2019s degree at the Escola Superior de M\u00fasica de Catalunya before moving to The Hague, where she studies with Vera Beths.

It was used extensively as an obbligato instrument in vocal repertoire throughout the eighteenth century, when it was a highly popular instrument in the major courts in Europe. The vocal repertoire that included chalumeau from this time period \u2013 as this work aimed to illustrate \u2013 is quite large and diverse. It accounts for several hundreds of pieces and it encompasses a wide range of genres, all with unique instrumentation. The development of the repertoire for chalumeau was directly linked to three Holy Roman Emperors and the political milieu in the Hofkapelle in Vienna during the first half of the eighteenth century. Besides Vienna, the chalumeau was extremely popular in other courts such as Dresden, Hamburg and Darmstadt; the latter proved to be an extremely fertile land for chalumeau writing with Johann Christoph Graupner, who included parts for different sizes of chalumeaux in more than eighty cantatas. Other prolific composers for chalumeau include Atilio Ariosti, the brothers Giovanni and Antonio Maria Bononcini, Antonio Caldara, Francesco Bartolomeo Conti, Johann Joseph Fux, Johann Adolph Hasse, Johann David Heinichen, Giovanni Alberto Ristori, Johann Franz Strall, Georg Philipp Telemann, Antonio Vivaldi, among others. After a thorough search through RISM (R\u00e9pertoire International des Sources Musicales) and other online library catalogues, a total of 203 vocal works that include one or more parts for chalumeaux is presented in this thesis. Performance practice and general considerations on the style of this repertoire are addressed as well, with emphasis on the genres of Cantata, Opera, Oratorio and Serenata, but also Antiphonies, Hymns, Litanies, Masses, Psalms and other sacred works that employed the instrument as well. In addition, this research has resulted in several world premiere recordings of music by Hasse and Caldara. Finally, considerations on the \u201cgloom\u201d color often associated with the chalumeau in secondary sources are contrasted with the descriptions of the instrument in primary sources and the evidence present in the works composed outside Vienna.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nSandra P\u00e9rez Romero (b.1992) is a Mexican born historical clarinetist.

There was something that fascinated the people of that time with the uncontrollable nature of madness. Henry Purcell and Thomas d\u2019Urfey was among the many writers and composers who dealt with this subject, and a selection of their mad songs and texts are the main focus of my research.\r\nFeelings such as love, hate, envy, sadness and happiness are feelings most of us have felt in our life, but madness is perhaps a state that is exclusive to some people. Is it then possible to portray this state of mind convincingly in a performance of the music? To answer this question, I have examined how madness was portrayed by Purcell and d\u2019Urfey, and generally how people that were considered mad was treated and viewed by the society. After researching the madness of the 17th century and what we today view as madness through music, text, historical documents and other forms of entertainment, I have come to the conclusion that it is possible to portray madness convincingly, but that madness is something completely different than the feelings previously mentioned. One person can view something as madness while someone else sees it as completely normal.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nMay Kristin Svanholm Hegvold is a soprano from Norway.

The reason is that saxophonists often need to improve their repertoire and that these pieces were already frequently transcribed during the period which were made. Also, there have been many saxophonists who have thought that this instrument can give something special to these kinds of works. Based on interviews, questionnaires, comparison of baroque transcriptions and my own experience documented through the whole process of a transcription, this research investigates what is the best way to transcribe and play violin baroque pieces for soprano saxophone. My main conclusion is when writing for these arrangements it is allowed to make many modifications from the original version but always depending on the characteristics of the instrument and the baroque transcription criteria and keeping the original intention of the composer. These results will give the saxophone world more sources of how to transcribe and play these pieces, keeping in mind the original idea of the composer in the baroque style and making it more useful for the instrument. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nJos\u00e9 Benjam\u00edn Falces Vaquero has had lessons with teachers like Vincent David, Ensemble Squillante, Berlage Saxophone Quartet, Arno Bornkamp and others.

We do not know which basso continuo instrumentation was intended or preferred by the composer, but it could have been possible that a double bass was to be used. At that time in the Netherlands, double basses and bassists were around and it is not unlikely that they also played in relatively small settings such as chamber music. If the double bass played the basso continuo line in this piece, there are many reasons that it was used in a different way than the more usual 'concerto grosso' style of playing the continuo line. It is also likely that instead of a double bass, a smaller bass instrument in the 8 foot register was used to double the continuo line with. This would be an instrument that is perhaps bigger than most baroque cellos and close to a basse de violon or a G-violone.\u2028To illustrate these possibilities, I have recorded several versions of the same Concerto with different basso continuo instrumentations.  \r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nEva Euwe (Amsterdam, 1988) studies historical double bass and violone with Margaret Urquhart at the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague.

The physical movements of the performer also have a strong influence on the way that meaning is perceived by the listeners. One of my main aims is to achieve a unity between my physical movements and expression, as well as a certain freedom and flexibility of my physical approach to piano playing. Over the course of this research I conducted experiments with various excerpts of the pieces I play, all of which represent a significant transition within the piece. These experiments gave me a good overview of what the influence of the physical movement is in relation to the expression and perception of a performance. What I observed from these experiments, reflecting on my aims, is that moving out of my comfort zone and expressing the meaning of the music, also by more exaggerated physical movements, made me feel free. It helped me discover new possibilities of playing and interpreting the music. Secondly, I realised that, by embedding musical ideas in my physical movements, technically challenging passages were not that difficult anymore. They became subservient to the musical ideas and character of the music. Thirdly, the exaggeration of physical movements sometimes created breathing space on very different spots compared to my usual way of playing. In these moments, I suddenly became more flexible. Finally, this process made me aware of the fact that my personal experience and the perception of the audience often differ widely. As a result of this inquiry, I am now more aware of the opportunities to express ideas that lead to a convincing performance.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nMartje van Damme was born in Kampen, the Netherlands.

In the context of a month-long festival around his music I had, at the time being a first-year piano student, the opportunity to play his first four Klavierst\u00fccke for him, and this, apart from being a very inspiring experience for me, resulted in a close cooperation that lasted for 20 years. During these years I worked with him on all his piano works, including Mantra, and performed them many times on different occasions, almost always in the presence of Stockhausen himself. In 1997\u20131998 I recorded all the solo piano pieces on the composer\u2019s label.\r\n\r\nDuring those years I was asked quite a few times, either by someone from the audience or by students that I taught during masterclasses, if I expected these pieces to become part of the \u201ccanon of piano music\u201d in fifty years from then.\r\n\r\nAt that time, being so involved in the piano pieces and probably not having the necessary distance to reflect on this question, I always answered the question in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nSo, it came as quite a shock to me when I started to notice a change by myself in relation to the piano pieces, at least to some of them. Normally, the more and longer I work on a piece the more I get attached to it, but now I started to realise that I got more and more detached from some of the pieces, up until the point that I didn\u2019t want to play them anymore. However, other piano pieces remained very dear to me, and this up until today.\r\n\r\nIn short, it seemed that within 20 years I had unconsciously made my own \u2018canon\u2019 with regard to Stockhausen\u2019s piano pieces. \r\n\r\nWhat I find intriguing about this experience is to find out what the reason is for this enormous difference in appreciation for the works of one composer. Why am I sure that some piano works of Stockhausen will still be played many years from now while, in my opinion, other works will fade? Can I put a finger on differences between the pieces which can justify this?

After discussing two further projects in which I acted as a mediator between composers and singers, I found my initial suspicions to be true: many composers do not receive enough education in composing for the voice, meaning that they do not respect its physical limitations, they often misjudge the combination of ranges, dynamics and colors possible, and they believe that any singer can reproduce any sound (regardless of culture, style, or tradition). Clearly, studying these elements while working closely with singers would be one solution, as would choosing a more performer-centric notational system including expression markings and other indications that invite singers to find the intention or subtext behind the music\u2014all of which can help the singer's instrument work more effectively. For their part, singers need more training in music theory, solfege and score reading skills, and while they need to master their classical technique, they must also be openminded and flexible enough to experiment beyond that training\u2014while staying within the healthy limits of their sound production, and knowing how to communicate in order to preserve these boundaries.

Several of the greatest performers have recorded it achieving impressive results. However, the piece presents key aspects from the Spanish folklore and French impressionism that, usually, are not taken into account. Searching information for my research, I discovered that the most important sources of inspiration come from \u00bbcante jondo\u00ab (a Spanish primitive chant), the Spanish guitar and the music of Claude Debussy. Thus, I found several examples that prove the connection and help the performer to make the interpretation as coherent as possible. The research process changed my vision about topics such as the role of the soloist, the interpretation of ornaments, melodic lines and rubato as well as the imitation of the guitar in De Falla's music. Furthermore, this information could also help not only pianist performing Nights in the Spanish Gardens, but also any musician playing Manuel de Falla's music. \r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nSamuel Tirado begins his studies in Salamanca, where he completed a bachelor degree with Patrin Garcia Barredo.

How can we utilise Harrell's knowledge of music and apply it to our own playing?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results: \r\nTom Harrell is one of those fascinating individuals that despite having history of weird behavior attributed to their illness like schizophrenia, managed to use his inspiration and hard work to become a jazz superstar and an idol to many trumpeters around the world. He is most often described by other musicians and his colleagues as a shy and modest person, both intelligent, and brilliant. In my research I was mostly analysing the brilliance of Mr. Harrell in his music. Beside the fact that he has written hundreds of compositions, some of which became standards, he is known for the lyricism of his playing, creating beautiful and melodic lines. I transcribed and analysed many of his solos to try and get into his way of thinking. He likes using aspects from the basic jazz vocabulary, but connects phrases in the way that it sounds very lyrical and appealing to the ear. He always chooses the prettiest notes and executes phrases with a warm sound. He rarely goes outside and when he does, he doesn't go far and always makes an esthetical figure out of it rather than to complicate things. In my research presentation I will be speaking more about his vocabulary and style of playing. I will demonstrate certain logical things he likes to play and how it can be practised and applied when playing with the band. You can clearly notice how much time and hard work Harrell invested in trumpet playing when you hear him consistently play his stuff through all 12 keys, with minimal difference in regard to the chorus played. His creativity can also be seen in his numerous compositions, which is something I will also touch in my research. Because of his mental condition, Tom Harrell had to live a very disciplinary life in order to make it work for him, which consequently also left him with many free hours to focus on his practising and writing.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nJan Toth is a trumpet player born in Croatia, currently residing and studying in The Netherlands.

While the French cantata composers adopted the Italian forms and technique, they all remained in their attempt of uniting the Italian form with the traditional French Lyrical style, the \u201canimated\u201d melodies that served as an artful Imitation of the French speech. Every carefully constructed airs are therefore always to some extent an oration. The \u201creprise\u201d in an air often stands as an confirmation of the periodic structure of the poem, which is the most powerful section where a singer confirms the statement made in the beginning. What sort of effects do we see in the reprise of Mont\u00e9clair\u2019s Cantata La mort de Didon? \u2026 such question asks for an contextual interpretation.\r\nBearing in mind that the composers have chosen the melody, ornaments and speech rhythms - in order to convey the emotions being expressed by the words, it is essential that a singer masters reciting the French poetry and to bare the task of practicing oration so that one can convey the various \u201caffects\u201d or \u201cpassions\u201d to the audience.\r\nToday we find the ingredients like \u201cthe quantity of syllable\u201d, \u201coratorical accents\u201d, \u201cdoubled consonants\u201d and the French vocal ornaments in B. de Bacilly\u2019s treatises Remarques curieuses sur L'art de bien chanter (1668). Furthermore, we find 18 variations of ornaments - each of them to serve different Expressions - described in Les Principes de Musique (Paris, 1736) by M. de Mont\u00e9clair.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nThe US/S-Korean Mezzo Soprano was born in Tokyo, Japan.

The fact that there are not many written pieces for double bass solo in Latino American traditional music and that I was born in a place where the migration movements made miscegenation of people, culture with Africa, Europe and Latino America, aroused my curiosity and my will is to build a project where I can bring this music to the double bass solo repertoire.

Sumary of Results:\r\nThe objective of this research is to analyse Karlheinz Stockhausen's HALT and KONTRABASS, both pieces from his opera cycle LICHT \u2013 Die sieben Tage der Woche. (LICHT \u2013 The Seven Days of the Week). The goal is to study how a performer can shape the interpretation of these pieces according with the symbology the composer uses in the cycle.\r\nLICHT is a cycle of seven operas, one for each day of the week. There are three main characters or archetypes. Michael, Lucifer and Eve. Each opera in the cycle has a particular symbol, colour and main subject and is named after the days of the week. MONTAG aus LICHT is Eve\u2019s Day; DIENSTAG aus LICHT is the day of Michael and Lucifer\u2019s Confrontation; MITTWOCH aus LICHT is the Day in which they reconciliate and cooperate; DONNERSTAG aus LICHT is Michael\u2019s Day; FREITAG aus LICHT is when Eve is tempted by Lucifer; SAMSTAG is the Fallen Angel Day and, finally, SONNTAG is Michael and Eve\u2019s Mystical Union.\r\nAll the musical material is based in Stockhausen\u2019s Superformula technique. Each character has a melody (called formula by the composer) written to represent their archetype; all three formulas placed in counterpoint is what is called Superformula.\r\nWith this study, using the knowledge of LICHT\u2019s symbols and musical construction, we believe that a richer and more accurate performance of HALT and KONTRABASS can be achieved. As result, we hope to bring more interest not only in Stockhausen\u2019s music but also to newly composed music in general.\r\nBiography:\r\nMiguel studied his Bachelor degree with David Monrabal in Murcia (Spain).

Did composers intentioanlly use this instrument and if so for what purpose?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results: \r\n\r\nWhen speaking about the clarinet, the first period of music we naturally associate with it is the Classical.  However, few realise that the history of the clarinet begins much earlier in the Baroque, with an instrument that we would today describe as \u2018primitive\u2019.  The Baroque clarinet was developed around 1700 in Germany.  It's repertoire and legacy is confined to about 50 years of music history.  Colloquially called the 'Mock Trumpet', the Baroque Clarinet is characterized by a bright and brilliant sound.  \r\n\r\nSome research has been done on the instrument already, particularily on its general history and repertoire.  However what remains missing is uncovering the Baroque Clarinet's role in sacred music.  Sacred music, particularily cantatas dominated musical life in the 18th century.  Cantatas were performed every Sunday as well as on special feasts throughout the ecclesiastical calendar.  Over the past two years, I have discovered a trove of cantatas containing parts specifically written for the Baroque Clarinet, some by well-known composers such as Telemann and Graupner and others unknown until now, such as Seibert and Kurz.  Coincidentally, most of the composers are of German origin, employed by various cities and/or courts across the German-speaking lands.\r\n\r\nThis research examines the repertoire and attempts to find a progression in the clarinet's use and role.  The instruments characteristic timbre meant it shared a symbiotic relationship with the trumpet, but did it ever shed its trumpet association and find its own voice?  Through analysis of the various cantata parts, I uncover that the clarinet was in some ways the 'perfect compromise'; able to sound brassy and brilliant when required, while also able to produce a sweet and singing tone.  The clarinet was also techinically more capable then its trumpet counterpart, because it was less confined to the harmonic series and able to play quicker notes melodically with more stepwise intervals.  \r\n\r\nIn November 2017, the Royal Consrvatorie's Early Music Department premiered two of Telemann's cantatas with clarient parts; Lobet den Herrn  TWV 1:1061 and Der Tod ist verschlungen in den Sieg TWV 1:320.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nAdrianna van Leeuwen-Steghaus, is a Canadian clarinettist specialising in historical instrument performance.

There are almost no horn methods based on the harmonics of the B flat horn. The traditional instrumental music lesson is mainly based on reproducing: a certain image on paper matches a fitting fingering thus producing the matching sound. When the sound is not matching the image than the teacher corrects this sound. I noticed that the children could play well when playing by themselves, but when they played together with other instruments they could easily play the whole phrase on the wrong pitch (wrong harmonics) but with the right fingerings. The horn is an instrument based on harmonic overtone series. Finding the logical steps on the valves of the horn is very difficult. Woodwind players have a logical system on the instrument playing diatonic series like do re mi. For the horn, with 3 valves, there is not a logical sequence playing diatonic series. This made me realize that some changes in the methodology are necessary for the horn to make an aural approach more logical for the beginning horn player. It also did me realize how extremely important it is for the young horn player to develop the inner hearing very well and make the logical steps from sound to symbol. My research paper investigates the possibilities to develop musical literacy in the horn lesson but also in the instrumental group lesson with transposing instruments. My main conclusion is that it is very important to make singing and moving a part of the horn lesson in order to develop inner hearing in relation to the horn. In that way the music will be understand and musical literacy can be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nKlaske de Haan studied horn at The Royal Conservatoire in The Hague and at the Fontys Conservatoire  in Tilburg with Herman Jeurissen.

The first cello treatise was not written until 1741 (Corette) and therefore most cellists will play this repertoire with a late 18th century (bow) technique. Repertoire which is written especially for the violoncello starts in the late 17th century, but a lot of this repertoire was still composed in the old style. \r\nIn short, my research contains the following elements: the bow, the bow-hold, bow-technique and other sources on articulation.  The sources used include mainly treatises and iconography (taking into account that not all iconography is appropriate). \r\nIconography shows us that there are a lot of possibilities to play the cello. In terms of bow hold, underhand bow hold is seen the most, but also overhand bow hold can be seen towards the end of the 17th century. The treatises by Sylvestre Ganassi, Riccardo Rognioni and Francesco Frognoni, were my main sources for bow-technique. Ganassi (16th century) already gives some very important \u2018rules\u2019 on string-playing that are still applicable today. Written in even greater detail concerning articulation, are the treatises for wind instruments. \r\nIn my opinion, those treatises are not only valuable for 17th century repertoire, but could be also a source of inspiration for any other repertoire. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nAnne-Linde Visser (The Netherlands, 1992) studies baroque cello with Lucia Swarts.

By studying the history of the instrument, I have found out that all the great jazz drummers have adopted and incorporated the 26 American drum rudiments in their playing, which include several sticking patterns \u201cborrowed\u201d from the classical music and the Swiss Army drum corps. These rudiments are like scales for melodic \u2013 instrument players, who have to practice and know them very well in order to gain technique and express themselves on their instruments. The same applies to drummers using these 26 sticking patterns. While I was listening to the great jazz drummers, I discovered that a perfect example for this is Philly Joe Jones. You can clearly hear in his soloing that he is using these rudiments in his own unique way, making them sound swinging and therefore adopting them into the bebop drumming. I therefore decided to take Philly Joe as my main \u201cmodel\u201d for this research. I started transcribing his solos and analyzing his phrasing, making my own variations and phrases based on this rudimental approach. My final result is that I can know phrase on the drums and express myself freely whenever I have to take a solo, without copying or playing standard phrases from jazz drummers like I used to do in the past, while still sounding authentic and true to the jazz drumming style. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nMarios Spyrou was born in Nicosia in 1990.

Direct contact with the open strings gave singers, accompanying themselves on the harp, unparalleled control over the instrument\u2019s timbral potential. This is reflected in the role of the instrument within musica secreta, private concerts at the courts of Ferrara and Modena stylistically favouring word painting and chromaticism, in ensembles such as the concerto delle donna and Baroni sisters. The expressive freedom of their art influenced poets and composers and contributed to the development of the seconda prattica at the turn of the sixteenth century. Indeed, voice and harp were held up as the ideal way to perform epic poetry, a reflection of the mesmerising contrast and colour their combined forces could deliver. How do we find this unique skill-set today from a broken line of tradition, contending with limited, conflicting primary resources? There is very little surviving repertoire specific to the instrument, and other sources such as paintings are static representations with considerable variation in position and placement of the instrument, body and hands, making it hard to replicate. In the years dedicated to exploring the arpa doppia, we harpists uncover these insights through shared motions and motivations of our forebears\u2014 finding a way to play like them by trying to vividly colour the text as they did. This is a way artistic research can bring to life the spectrum of lost practice and technique. My research has resulted in the creation of timbral notation for the arpa doppia, easily added to music notation and publishing software. This notation is designed to help recreate as much as possible all the timbral refinement found by the hands of masterful singer-harpists. It documents, builds upon and preserves the invaluable research of historical practitioners, using visual, contact-based diagrams to provide clarity in understanding this evocative and highly specialised art form. With this foundation of \u00a0timbre and text, it aims to reconstitute the virtuosity, influence and innovation of the original arpa doppia players, through our shared practice today. \u00a0\r\n\u2028Biography: \r\n\r\nWhile playing as the Australian Youth Orchestra's Principal Harpist, and as a fellow of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, Kit Spencer's Honours degree culminated in studying Berio's infamous Sequenza II with its foremost interpreter, Alice Giles.

It is possible to choose any kind of key for a symphonic transcription but the choice always has consequences. For example, the chosen key has consequences for the amount of sharps and flats in the individual parts for the different instruments. Another very important consequence, while a different key is chosen, is the choice for the solo parts in a transcription. Every instrument has its limitations within a chosen key because of the \u201climited\u201d register for a particular solo instrument. The hard part in my research is the question: \u201cWhat is success\u201d? And how is it possible to define \u201csuccess\u201d? When a different key, another key than what is written in the original composition is chosen, some people will say the \u201ccolour\u201d of the composition has also changed. Some people say they can feel and hear it but as we all know a lot of thoughts in music are subjective. So how can we define its success when a lot of things are subjective? What is good, better or wrong?\r\nLuckily, I have found some measurable facts to define the success of a symphonic transcription.\r\nMy main conclusion, at this moment, is that the success of a symphonic transcription is based on several choices. First you will need to choose a key for the transcription that fits the ensemble in a natural way. When this key is chosen with knowledge about the limitations of the ensemble the transcription has to be instrumented in a high level of craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nJohan Smeulders finished his first Bachelor degree in 2011 as a euphonium player at the Fontys Conservatoire in Tilburg.

This particular instrumentation consists of a standard vocal ensemble, 4 voices concertate, accompanied by a group of string instruments: 2 violas, a cello (or 2 celli) and a double bass. Jos\u00e9 Joquim dos Santos and Luciano Xavier dos Santos are the composers who exploited this instrumentation best, covering all the needs for music in the Officium tenebrarum. An analysis of two Lamentations by Jos\u00e9 Joaquim dos Santos and Luciano Xavier dos Santos explores the relation between music and rhetorical tools and how the viola relates to them. Besides being a precious rhetorical tool itself, the analysis discloses that the violas and the low string instruments become a practical replacement for the harmonic instruments. In a liturgy where the organ was officially forbidden there is a need for an instrument or several instruments that could absolve that crucial function. Thanks to his ability in blending with and supporting the voices and, at the same time, respecting the solemnity and the sobriety of the liturgy, the viola became the best organ replacement. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nEnrico Ruggieri was born in 1982, graduated in piano, studying with Paolo Russo and Rachele Marchegiani.

In what way does the treatment of these elements differ in each piece? \r\n\r\n2. Did George Lloyd succeed in combining his own views with the demands of the test-piece commissions, to write an appropriate test-piece? Summary of Results:  Cornish symphonic and opera composer George Lloyd has written several compositions for brass, starting with a symphony for brass ensemble (Symphony no. 10) and then several test-pieces for brass band. The commission of test-pieces for brass band contests appears to be guided only by implicit criteria for these sort of compositions. Lloyd\u2019s first test-piece, Royal Parks, apparently did not meet the criteria and his second test-piece, Diversions on a Bass Theme, did. This thesis investigates if George Lloyd changed his way of composing to write an appropriate test-piece, by a detailed analysis of Symphony no. 10, Royal Parks and Diversions on a Bass Theme. Besides that the thesis will try to answer the question if Lloyd was able to combine his own musical views with the demands of the test-piece commissions. The main findings are that Lloyd remained within his own musical language when writing the test-pieces, however he made some decisive choices regarding structure, form and thematic material that influenced the compositions significantly. He did partially succeed in combining his own views with the demands of the test-piece commissions.

Ways to treat the fusion of text and music, as can be seen from the literature, are presented in the story that I wrote, a story that is meant to be narrated with early Romantic music. The Melodrama that developed in the 70s' of the 18th century, although disregarded by some critics, became - mostly in the Germanic countries, a popular genre, used by composers from Benda through Mozart and Beethoven, to Liszt and Humperdinck.\r\nIn a world that constantly looked for musical innovations, melodrama gave a new meaning for that primary connection of music and text. So how is this text-music relation kept? Are there clear principals in composing music to recited text as can be learned from Melodramas in the Romantic period?\r\nRepresentative melodramas by early and late romantic composers are discussed. \r\nThe Melodrama developed due to changes in the artistic approach to the fusion of music and text. From its early days of Rousseau and Benda and the autonomy they sought to give to each art, to the complete immersion and fusion of the two in the Melodramas of Schuman, Liszt and Humperdinck, highlighting the qualities of both arts.    \r\nThe core of this work is my own intake on Melodrama. I brought examples from the story that I wrote for different fusions of recited text and music. Unlike Melodramas where music is written to text, here the process is reversed and text was written to music. \r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nYotam Gaton was chamber music oriented from an early age, performing as concertmaster and principal second violin with Israel\u2019s finest chamber ensembles.\u2028Yotam joined the IDF and served as the leader and first violinist of the IDF string quartet where he wrote and performed series of lecture concerts.\u2028Former member and concertmaster of the European Union Baroque Orchestra, Yotam played with renowned ensembles such as Les Arts Florissants and performed in Europe's most important Early Music festivals.

The goal of this research has been to build more than one orchestral version of some of these variations in order to help piano students (as well as myself) arrive at more than one interpretation of the piece. In order to explore this idea of interpretive multiplicity and flexibility in the Variations, I based my transcription process on Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances: a work that the composer produced first for orchestra and afterwards for piano duo. During my analysis of the Symphonic Dances I tried to understand the composer's view of the relationship between orchestral and pianistic timbres so that I could then apply similar characteristics to my own transcriptions.\r\nAs pianists we are frequently asked to think and play orchestrally, but sometimes we do not have the inspiration or tools to experiment with new sonorities and modes of sound production. In making these transcriptions, I have been able to explore and expand my own relationship with this work, while also opening up my mind to the interpretive possibilities inherent in other familiar piano works. In my presentation I will highlight elements of my analysis and transcription process before demonstrating their effects on my interpretation of Rachmaninoff's Variations at the piano.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nRaquel Garz\u00e1s was born in Spain in 1992.

One player did all those things at the end of the 18th century with the use of his instrument, the clarinet. Although mentioned in all history books about the clarinet, today\u2019s scholars have done little research on Josef Beer. However, when looking closer at Beer\u2019s life, repertoire and works, we notice how much he had the chance to be at the right place at the right moment. A known teacher of many of the greatest clarinet virtuosi, such as Michel Yost and Heinrich Baermann, he had influenced a generation of young musicians, popularizing his instrument all over Europe with his extensive tours. But what do we really know about Josef Beer and what made him stand out to become such an influential musician?\r\nThis research is about the life and works written for and by this intriguing man, as well as a reflection on the general implication of the soloist in clarinet concerti and how the music he played became extremely personal, by the addition of unique ornamentation and variations of the \u201cskeleton\u201d - the score - made by the composer. Mainly biographical and historical, this work aims also to approach Beer through the performances of works by composers gravitating around him, including his own compositions.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nMaryse Legault is currently pursuing a Master\u2019s degree at the Koninklijk Conservatorium Den Haag in historical clarinets in the class of Eric Hoeprich.

In fact, musicians have being increasingly interested in historical articulation, phrasing, instrumentation, ornamentation, tempi, etc. Surprisingly, historical conducting practices have not been significantly investigated and hardly ever in a practical way. It may be the reason why there is a lack of experimentation in this domain, why even Early Music ensembles are using the modern way of conducting, which is to have an interpretative conductor that stands in front of the group. Would it not also be relevant to know how composers like Mozart, Handel or Bach would have \u201cconducted\u201d their works? Did Mozart conduct his wind serenade \u201cGran partita\u201d by making gestures like we can see in Forman's movie Amadeus? Can we learn from their practical experience?

In this research project I have concentrated primarily on the latter, and have sought to determine the particular challenges and possibilities presented by varying types of venues, and how such knowledge can be used to guide the conscious decisions performers make in order to adapt their performances accordingly. \r\nMy methodology first involved carrying out background research, using relevant academic literature as well as my own experiences as a pianist. By focusing on three types of venues (concert halls, music clubs, and private homes), I was then able to compile a list of the advantages and challenges presented by each type of performance space. From this list I then prepared three different interpretations of Ferruccio Busoni's transcription of the Chaconne from J. S. Bach's Partita in D Minor, with each interpretation being specially adapted to the limitatons and possibilities presented by each of the three venue types. I then tested each interpretation by performing it in its respective venue, the results of which I documented via audio and video recordings. I was then able to analyse the effectiveness of my venue-specific interpretative decisions in these recordings, after which I compiled a table that can function as a guide for adjusting one's performances to specific venues. By carrying out this research project, I have found that in order to better communicate with their audiences, musicians can and should adjust their performances to specific types of venues. While musicians make many smaller adjustments instinctively, as related to voicing or phrasing for example, learning the logic and mechanics behind such modifications emboldens one to make larger changes as related to tempo and even character \u2013 an interpretive flexibility towards which all musicians should strive.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nPianist Gregor De\u0161man studies with Prof. Naum Grubert at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.

However, this was likely because of logistical restraints. Is there an instrumentation for percussion ensemble possible, and if so, how would it sound?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\n\r\nAfter researching about different prepared piano pieces by John Cage, we can realise that Bacchanale is the most suitable to be rewritten for percussion instruments due to its sonority and circumstances of composition. The piece was conceived for percussion instruments but there was not enough room in the theater to set up all these instruments. Therefore, Cage composed Bacchanale for a piano with different found objects placed into strings. For this research, a set of percussion instruments, similar to the ones that Cage\u00b4s ensemble had, imitates the prepared piano\u00b4s sonority. All the original sounds have been distributed in its corresponding drums and the composition has been transcribed to be played by four percussionists. During the presentation, both the reconstruction procedure and video recordings of the transcription will be shown to the audience. In this way, the audience will be able to understand why this piece can be perfectly played in a concert using percussion instruments, how can we came up with this result and what is its sonority.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nGorka was born in 1992 in Miranda de Ebro (Spain), where he started his music studies.

Throughout the research I realised that finding ways to immerse an audience is easier said than done. My belief in immersion as a tool to guide listeners towards a certain atmosphere, attitude or interpretation is nevertheless still as strong as before. More than ever, I am convinced that this is the way for me to perform. This is particularly the case for contemporary music where inexperienced listeners might appreciate some guidance. This paper aims to inform (performing) readers of the possible (positive and negative) consequences of creating an immersive performance. Creating an immersive performance is difficult. It takes a lot of time, something musicians often do not have. In addition to learning the music, the performer needs time to brainstorm about the kind of immersion that supports the musical idea and does not distract from it. The line between the two is very thin. Once the immersion concept is established it often takes a lot of preparation to execute it. To bring elaborate ideas to fruition musicians will need the help of technicians, engineers, other artists etc. This explains why immersive performances are often organised by ensembles that rely on a bigger production team and budget. The danger here lies in the fact that those teams are often too far removed from the actual content of the music. Realising this made me think about other ways to connect with an audience. I concluded that besides immersion, also attitude and mindset are very powerful tools to decrease the distance between a performer and the audience. Low-tech solutions like literally performing very close to or surrounded by them are very effective to emotionally connect with the audience.  Because of the reflective character of the topic I chose to write my dissertation in the form of an essay. My goal is not to present 'the ultimate truth' but to inspire myself and other musicians to create a personal (contemporary) performing identity. \r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nJonathan Bonny (\u00b01992, Bruges) studied classical percussion at the School of Arts in Ghent, the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague.

Unfortunately, not everybody can afford a studio and qualified technicians to have a good final result. However, nowadays, there is low budget equipment (microphones, sound cards, hand recorders, among others) that, when used in a proper way, can provide good results. Being fascinated by the recording and studio worlds, I began to take interest in this particular matter.\r\nDuring the past year and a half, I have focused on recording bass players, with different approaches to the instrument and repertoire. There are some factors to take into consideration regarding my experiences: each player was using their own instrument; the recordings were made in different environments (except the ones used for comparison); the same mic settings were used, in order to make a more precise comparison between two different instruments; and all the recordings were made in solo context, with no other instruments involved. The focus was only on capturing the sound (without editing). \r\nIn conclusion, I believe that a double bass recording can improve significantly even with low cost equipment, when used in a proper way.\r\nMy main goal with this research was to gather my experiences and recommendations into an accessible guide for double bass home recordings. \t\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nJo\u00e3o Pedro Almeida Lucas began his double bass studies in 2006 with Romeu Santos at EPABI (Professional Music School of Beira Interior), Covilh\u00e3, Portugal.

Prior to 1787, when Etienne Ozi published his first edition of the Nouvelle Methode de Basson, there are no sources known that specifically discuss articulation or (double) tonguing on bass double reed instruments. When we perform music from this era, we are in the dark as how to articulate highly virtuosic passages. What is preferable: Two-by-two slurring? Slurs over more notes, or maybe the use of some kind of double tongue-stroke? \r\nDuring this research I will focus on primary sources that deal with articulation on various non-reed wind instruments of the period in question, such as the recorder, the cornetto and the trumpet. By studying the indications and recommendations given by masters of the past we can deduce their musical intensions. When we accept these authors as our guides, they may be able to help us imagining what articulation on a double-reed instrument could sound like. The moment we envision this concept, we can start to translate their instructions into articulation on reed instruments. \r\n\r\nThe output is threefold:\r\n1. A paper describing the different ways on how to articulate fast passagework on the dulcian and on the bassoon in a way that matches the souplesse and speed of non-reed instruments.\r\n2.

Although they appear in a whole variety of ways, and can have very diverse effects, music analysis rarely pays attention to these differences. The reason is, perhaps, that there are no defined concepts that would provide vocabulary to both describe and understand the power of sustained notes. My first research question addresses the \u2018working\u2019 of pedals and drones:\r\nHow can we explain the perceptual difference among instances of pedal tones and drones?  \r\nIn searching for the right perspective to tackle this question I have come to two concepts that inspired the further research. The first is the concept of expectation. It is mostly promoted by the writings of Leonard B. Meyer (in the more recent time it is researched and developed by others), which I take as conceptual frame. The second is the concept of interactions that defines and organizes the musical events. The inspiration for the latter came from the social studies. The two concepts are interrelated: the expectation is a product of interactions of musical elements, and the expectations are also involved in interactions, thereby influencing the perception and understanding of a musical piece. My following research questions are:\r\nCould the concept of musical expectation and the concept of interaction help explain the power of long notes? If yes, in which ways can these processes influence the perception of pedals and drones?\r\nIn the process of research, I have concluded that there are several categories of pedals/drones that are not labeled in music theory but are recognizable by many music theorists and musicians. Pointing at these categories and defining them could provide us with more words in pedal/drone-vocabulary. On the other hand, in case these models are recognizable as such, they have the potential to engage in various interactions with the other musical events in the piece, influencing the listener\u2019s understanding of it. From this perspective, it is relevant to examine them. The current research aims at pointing at a number of such models. To define them, I have used the concepts of expectations and interactions. Music analysis of the chosen models and a number of musical fragments are so presenting the practical application of my theoretical research."}, {"id": 360420, "type": "exposition", "title": "Searching for Sattler", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/13/0e/35/03/130e3503186305d2967423a26dcb4265.png?t=5ef542e0bd8d60a5af524fd5456a3908&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/360420/360421", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=360420", "keywords": ["Trombone", "Christoph Penzel", "Christian Friedrich Sattler", "instrument building", "19th century", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "09/05/2017", "last-modified": 1500468831, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "19/07/2017", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 215139, "name": "Timothy Dowling (KC)"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Abstract\r\nName: Timothy Dowling\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Trombone\r\n\r\nResearch Supervisor: Charles Toet\r\n\r\nTitle of research: \u201cSearching for Sattler; Reproducing a Romantic Trombone\u201d.

Is it now possible to build a truly idiomatic mid nineteenth century German style trombone based upon traditional techniques that truly reflects the sound world of the early nineteenth century orchestra?\r\n\r\nSummary of results: \r\nAfter extensively examining in detail the use of trombones in orchestras between 1808 and 1851 in an historical context, I have concluded that the current common practice of performing the trombone parts of the music of mid century German composers such as Mendelssohn and Schumann on the standard reproduction classical trombones of three different sizes and pitches : alto, tenor, and bass, is unlikely to be an accurate representation of the instruments used, particularly in Leipzig, during the time period of Mendelssohn\u2019s directorship of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, where most of this repertoire was first performed. After meeting instrument builders, instrument collectors, and viewing and measuring many instruments in museums and private collections, I have concluded that it is possible and desirable to design and build a set of  Romantic reproduction trombones based on models of the Leipzig master instrument builder Christian Friedrich Sattler and his successor Johann Christoph Penzel, that could accurately represent the trombone sound for which Mendelssohn and Schumann wrote. In this study I have made a detailed proposal (within the scope of my expertise) as to how these instruments should be built and it is my fervent hope that in so doing I can add to the understanding and advancement of nineteenth century trombone performance practice among trombonists for both  \u201cauthentic\u201d performance practitioners and modern symphonic trombonists.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nMelbourne-born trombonist Timothy Dowling began his professional career in Australia in 1979, performing in four different Australian orchestras before being appointed to his current position of solo trombonist of the Residentie Orchestra in The Hague in 1988.

In addition, I realised that during my career as a performing bassoonist I have seen changes which I did not understand. \r\nMy study has opened the door to a wide range of possibilities and follow-up steps for me to take. I now understand why I found a number of things difficult in classical music performance. As far as I am concerned that is closely related to the fact that I was trained to reproduce music from notation, whereas I think that making music is much more than merely reproducing something. Splendid masterworks have been composed throughout musical history and I can thoroughly enjoy them if I am given the chance to play them. However, for me, that is not the only way to make my musical voice heard. I also need to speak a living musical language with my pupils and colleague musicians. If self-expression is an important part of the new learning, then I think that it is essential I develop musical expression with my pupils in order to speak a living musical language.\r\nIt would be extremely interesting in a follow-up study to investigate how the language develops and then to see what is necessary to develop a living musical language-one in which you learn to listen, speak, read, write and interpret.\r\nBy doing this research I have come to understand how aspects from the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy and methodology can be integrated into instrumental education and I can see that this is enriching.\r\nIt has given me many insights and a broad palette of tools which I can use to work in the profession in a more creative and innovative manner. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nI studied bassoon, contrabassoon and chamber music at the conservatories of Maastricht and Amsterdam at the end of the 1980s.

Through the centuries of this huge country\u2019s history, art has always been of great importance, no matter what the political situation was. The world still honors their cultural heritage, their literature, dance and music. Russian music has always touched and inspired me so it was obvious to specialize during my master in this subject.\r\nBecoming myself a performing musician I wanted to investigate what this Russian music is about. What are the characteristics and how do Russian performers play? I wanted to get as close as possible to the \u2018Russian way of playing\u2019. Focusing on Vladislav Solotarjow\u2019s \u2018Chambersuite\u2019 or \u2018Sentimental pieces to Alexander Blok\u2019, made me develop my Russian way of playing. I have done this through listening, analyzing and comparing recordings, from Mika Vayrynen a Scandinavian bayanist and one of Russia\u2019s most important bayanists Friedrich Lips and making my own recordings. This research has proved to me that the Russians play very expressive, with a lot of passion and freedom. Both their music and their instrument are very colorful. I have achieved many of these characteristics in my own playing, even adding my own personal style to it in the end. Only the colorfulness of sound was still missing sometimes. Wondering about my technique and musical decisions, I took the chance to compare the two instruments with each other.  My accordion built in Western Europe (Castelfidardo, Italy) versus the Russian-built Bayan (Moscow). It was really helpful to investigate the history of the instrument, the history of Russia and their music in order to get as close as possible to the Russian way of playing. Furthermore, reading about Solotarjow\u2019s life, analysing his composition and listening to different recordings, greatly improved my understanding of this music. These things have helped me to develop my artistic practice. The part of the research that directly involved my artistic practice has been of great value for me. It has enriched my expressive pallet by including more freedom in my playing in many different aspects. I have concluded that it is possible to achieve the Russian way of playing. I have also found that besides having background information about the history of the country, knowledge about the composer and the composition, it is important to have or to imagine the Russian soul. Next to this, it is also important to be open to a different way of playing. A way of playing that might be unfamiliar to a performer.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nMy name is Elisa van Kesteren and was born in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.

This is a collection of country-dances, broad street ballads, theatre tunes, tunes from Morris dancing, Scottish tunes and French dances, that were published for the amateur violinist in 1670.

This paper also concludes that other elements of baroque music not included in this study, such as rhetorical devices and improvisation could be investigated, and exploring folk music repertoire of the seventeenth century would provide our students with a richer experience of the baroque style.\r\nBiography:\r\nRyuko Reid is a baroque violinist specialising in historically informed performance practice and is the artist director and leader of Amsterdam Corelli Collective.

My background as a school teacher has taught me that singing can be used in a variety of ways to help children to learn skills such as reading and aural skills and so my wish is to investigate ways in which singing can be used in a music theory lesson at a conservatoire level.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years at the Koninklijk Conservatorium (Royal Conservatoire of The Hague), the music theory department has been investigating ways in which skills can be transferred across disciplines. One change that has been made is that many music theory related subjects are now taught as a single subject. Teachers are now free to make connections where ever they are found. My own interest is on the use of singing as a tool to achieve these ends.\r\n\r\nMy own investigation, as show in this research paper, will show models of lessons that can be created where singing is used as a core part of the lesson. A range of skills can be developed and theoretical concepts understood when singing activities are sequenced well and taught carefully. The result will be a model for other teachers to use and adapt for their own teaching.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the result of the research has also produced a collection of vocal material for teachers to use in lesson in order to encourage singing with advise on how to use it within a lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nEwan L.

This was my starting point.\r\nHowever, my research has led me to discover over a dozen works especially written for\r\nthe purpose of introducing contemporary techniques to students.\r\nContemporary studies that prepare students for playing twentieth and twenty-first century\r\nmusic do exist but are not yet included in the standard pedagogic literature every student\r\nhas to master to obtain a degree in music. A strong emphasis is on transcribed violin\r\netudes that are better suited for the repertoire of the nineteenth century, which does not\r\nform a big part of the traditional repertoire for viola.\r\nBiography:\r\nThora Margr\u00e9t Sveinsd\u00f3ttir was born in 1987 and grew up in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland.

There are 2 main reasons for the invention in this time period: the start of the romantic period (composers were looking for new \u2018ways\u2019 and also new instruments) and the industrial revolution (without the right machines it is impossible to build a tuba). So around this time the technical possibilities and the \u201ccomposers\u2019 psychology\u201d were exactly right to invent the tuba. The most important ancestors of the tuba are the serpent and the ophicleide. The serpent was a wooden instrument with holes and the ophicleide a brass instrument with keys. They both don\u2019t have valves so the invention of the valves was an important development. One of the first pieces that are written for tuba is Wagner\u2019s  Ein Faust Overture. To see the change from ophicleide to tuba it is interesting to analyze also some pieces with opicleide parts, like Wagner\u2019s Rienzi, Berlioz\u2019 Symphonie Fantastique and Mendelssohn\u2019s Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. The register in ophicleide parts is generally higher than in tuba parts (and even lower in contrabass tuba parts, like Wagner\u2019s Rheingold). Also the doublings and the role of ophicleide can be different than the role of the tuba. The ophicleide is more a bass instruments for woodwinds while the tuba is more connected to the brass.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nStefan Knuijt, born on 15 September 1992 in Nieuw -en Sint Joosland, started playing the baritone when he was 8 years old.

Not all notes can be played on the baroque trumpet, this is because the baroque trumpet has only the notes of its own overtone series, so not all the chromatic/diatonic notes can be played. Therefore one can also not play in all the keys and notes in diatonic sequence can only be produced in the highest \u201cclarino\u201d register. It is also questionable whether a (brass) wind instrument with its fixed mouth piece and limits on articulation because of this can hope to imitate the many delicate possibilities for articulation and sound achievable on the violin with its strings and many bowing techniques. The baroque trumpet also had a complete different function. It was first a ceremonial instrument and war instrument. It is likely that in these functions they weren\u2019t suspected to add ornamentation to their music. As trumpeters\u2019 skills improved, they started to play in the higher \u201cclarino\u201d register. So later the trumpet became an instrument of Art. How to play ornaments in Leopold Mozart\u2019s concerto for clarino? And how to interpret the ornaments written in his treatise for the violin on the natural/baroque trumpet? was one of my main questions. Besides Leopold Mozarts treatise I also did research on\r\nTartini\u2019s \u201ctreatise on ornaments in music\u201d and \u201cOn playing the flute\u201d by\r\nQuantz. I do now better understand how to interpret the written ornaments and how to play them. Some ornaments you don\u2019t see, as far as I know, in the trumpet literature. Are they impossible to play? Not all, but also not easy, mostly it could be possible in the clarino register. But it also depends on how the composers wrote for the trumpet.\r\nBiography:\r\nRudolf Weges is an all-round professional trumpeter.

However, most recorder players today do not use the instruments that were most commonly used in the Baroque period, i.e. those with historical fingering systems. Instead, we normally use instruments with \u201cmodern fingering,\u201d a slight modification that simplifies fingerings and homogenizes notes. With our modern instruments and their different fingering systems, several notes and trills do not work with the existing fingering charts for Baroque recorders. The Investigation of this research, on 7 actual original 18th century recorders from England, Germany, and France, and 40 fingering charts from historical methods shows us; it is a very logical system. The people at the time were playing the recorders in a different way, with differently tuned instruments. Fingerings on the recorder have always been found by trial and error, by players, with their own comfort and ease in mind. Though it is clearly not possible to know how the people in the Baroque period were choosing their fingerings; the best approximation is to have the same instrument tuned in the same system from the time. Historical tutors allow us to realize how their system of thought was different, which helps us to get closer to them. A bit of effort to accept the valuable tips from centuries past, with a taste for authenticity on the Baroque-fingered recorder, is a necessity.\r\nBiography:\r\nKoske Nozaki (Tokyo, 1988) began playing recorder at the age of 9. He loved the friendliness of such a simple flute with so many possibilities, and had a lot of curiosity for repertoire and the instrument itself. His school life at a beautiful seaside was focused on the recorder ensemble with his friends, which taught him a lot of basic musical knowledge. In his high school life, on a mountain this time, he learned not only recorder, but cello in the school orchestra as well. He studied recorder and Early Music performance at The National Tokyo University of Fine Arts and Music, where he obtained his Bachelor degree.

This reaction obtained its clearest form at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, with first Kees van Baaren and his students, and later Louis Andriessen with his fellow composers and his ensembles (Hoketus, for example). Because of the string characteristics of this reaction, the composition department in The Hague was labelled the \u201cHaagse School\u201d, but in my paper, I investigate how these characteristics are merely superficial, and there is a much broader view to the Haagse School than you would expect. Afterwards, I look at the list of clarinet compositions from The Hague, just to see that there are not many, and the ones we have, are very difficult to obtain (both recordings and sheet music). Making these pieces more well known might also give a stimulus to new composers from The Hague, to write for clarinet. For this paper I had e-mail contact and interviews with several composers and musicologists who were (remotely) connected to The Hague and its composition department.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nVincent Martig started playing the clarinet when he was eight years old.

Both focusses are needed during lessons but when you act like a coach the responsibility is with the pupils. This creates ownership which has a positive effect on the involvement of the pupils and the quality of the music making. By encouraging the collaborative aspect in music lessons, the formation of the pupils plays an important part. There should always be enough variety in formations but by playing an activity in a circle they automatically make a natural connection and it has a positive influence on the group dynamics and the involvement of the pupils.

In this research paper, I analyzed what singers do and how we can transfer some of their resources to cello playing so it can enrich our sense of communication. The results that I came up with are the following: \u2022I have experienced that the use of singing during practice improves the advantage of the time you spend. \u2022Through singing, it is much easier to find your own interpretation and then be able to transmit it to the cello \u2022The use of inner singing while performing gives you much more focus in music and not in technical aspects of the playing. \u2022The importance of breath in playing; the amount of energy that it can give to you, is one the most valuable things I have discovered in my playing.

What was the playing technique of horn used in orchestral music in the 19th century?\r\nSummary of results and little explanation: This paper researches the development of horn playing technique throughout the 19th century. And the result of my research is the natural horn and valve horn are completely different instruments. Starting from the point of the natural horn, which was the instrument used at the beginning of the century, it describes the changes made to the horn itself, most notably the incorporation of valves. Through examples drawn from orchestral repertoire from three periods of the 19th century (the beginning of the 19th century: 1800-1840, the middle: 1840-1890, the late: 1890-1910). From simple parts in Beethoven's 3rd symphony through the increasingly difficult and complex parts of works by, among others, (Rossini, Schumann, Brahms, Mahler, Strauss) many aspects of the evolving technique of playing the horn are described. The paper concludes that now modern horn players should be aware of these developments, and also be able to play in the styles and on the instruments of the periods, such as the natural horn with hand stopping. It are very helpful to modern horn players when playing the music from the classical to the beginning of the romantic period. \r\n\r\nShort biography of the student: I was born in Gwangyang city, South Korea.

After performing this concerto, I realized that it is very important to have some methods to keep the piece in high performance standard. I saw that it is not possible to be limited with general piano playing traditions for fingering because of non-standardly written passages. By switching the lines on both hands we can make it much more comfortable to perform. Also by analyzing both the orchestral and solo part, we can have more clear idea about the role of the piano solo. Such a great artists recordings as Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, David Oistrakh and Mstislav Rostropovich who were friends and the first interpreters of several compositions of Prokofiev are the closest references for the idea of his music.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nHe started his piano education at the age of ten at Antalya Conservatory with Samir Mirzoev.

When I established who these two cellists were, I was hoping to find more information on each of them. It was at this slightly disheartening point in my research, that I decided to look into the other musicians that would have worked in the Hofkapelle with Ignaz Mara.\r\nI was incredibly pleased whilst researching the two families, which played an important role in the musical goings on, not only in the court, but also in the more private events, that my research into both the Benda and the Graun families led to three unknown works that I could add to my repertory of this period in Berlin. It was obviously not what I had hoped for, but it was a result, nonetheless and one that still had room to build on.\r\nHaving decided on eliminating certain areas of research for the sake of focusing on a narrower period of time and within a smaller geographical area, I have still become far more aware of the other musicians around Germany at the time, and have begun to build the connection between a time in Berlin when there was practically no music-making happening, under Friedrich II\u2019s father, Friedrich Wilhelm I\u2019s leadership, to a period when the cellistic development in Berlin flourished, under Friedrich Wilhelm II\u2019s reign (a cellist himself), during the late eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nGeorge Ross is a British cellist, specialising in period instrument performance, currently in the second year of his master\u2019s studies at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague where he receives lessons from Jaap ter Linden.

Ultimately, Jewish individuals who deepened their social awareness, contributed disproportionately by expressing their inner richness to the arts.\r\nQuite often composers of Jewish descent are being programmed because of their presumed identity. German speaking Jews shared in general a deep respect for German culture, language and national identity. Almost all of Jewish intellectuals identified themselves above all as \u2018German\u2019. In order to outline the social context of several influential Jewish composers, a journey leads us through correspondence and thoughts by intellectuals from the nineteenth century to the landmark of the Second Viennese School and Expressionism.\r\nEveryone\u2019s artistic and personal development is an individual occasion. Jewish composers shared in general a high awareness of their social position and the political developments in the societies they were part of. The historical background of German-ruled Europe in the nineteenth century is important to understand the eventually cruel fate. German culture was both inclusive as exclusive, as I described in an introducing chapter on historical and social developments.\r\nGradually artists of Jewish descent and loyalty were confronted with the downside of their culture: Exclusion. Today, we have access to an enormous amount of information, such as musical sources, correspondence, publications and interviews.

Many compositions that are not originally written for the guitar have gained a place in the standard repertoire. Especially making arrangements of Baroque violin music is a long established tradition. My research aims to continue this tradition by presenting three arrangements of the Mystery Sonatas by Heinrich Biber, who was undoubtedly one of the most famous violinists and composers of the 17th century. This research describes the arranging process of these compositions and how a classical guitarist can use the basso continuo practise as a central tool when arranging pieces with melody and continuo. Some performance aspects of 17th century music will also be discussed as well as different arranging methods for the guitar. The final product of this research is the arrangements of Mystery Sonatas III, IV and V by Heinrich Biber, which show the information gathered in the research paper in practice. The presentation will go deeper into different methods I used in making these arrangements visually through PowerPoint and contain audible examples of my arrangements.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nAntero Pellikka (born in 1988) is a Finnish guitarist.

Is it an advantage to have an instrumental background as a singer and vice versa?\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nI am a professional cellist in the Residence Orchestra of The Hague, but I have always been singing next to my career as a cellist. When I started my Masters in classical singing in 2014, I was confronted with the fact that in many ways singing is really different from playing an instrument, as well physically, technically as mentally. But in some ways it feels the same. The question arose: are there real differences between singing and playing an instrument, and what are they exactly?\r\nThis Research paper gives an answer to the question what the differences are between playing an instrument and singing, and explains them. In seven chapters I compare the physical instrument, the location of pitch, text versus musical language, personality, etc\u2026 I found that it is an advantage to have an instrumental background as a singer and vice versa. There are also big differences between singing and playing an instrument. The research is based on a questionnaire, interviews, books and my own experiences as a cellist and singer.\r\nBiography:\r\nSven Weyens (\u00b01974, Antwerp) started playing the cello at the age of ten with Frieda Celis. He studied in Antwerp, Leuven, Ghent, Zwolle and Detmold under Jaap Kruithof, Hans Mannes, France Springuel, Jeroen Reuling and Marcio Carneiro. In 1998 he obtained his Masters Degree with great distinction. He also took masterclasses with Harro Ruysenaars, Schmoel Magen, Francois Guy, Wolgang Laufer, Valentin Erben and Thomas Kakuschka.\r\nHe is a member of the Residence Orchestra (The Hague Philharmonic) since 2004. Besides that, he has specialised in chamber music. He performed with a.o. the Josef Aschtak Trio, with whom he toured in the U.S. and Portugal. Sven gave masterclasses in the U.S. and Switzerland. In September 2014 Sven Weyens started a masters in Classical singing with Sasja Hunnego at the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague. Since then, he has performed regularly in the chamber music series of the Residence Orchestra and sang the part of \u201cTe fish\u201d in the summer of 2014 in \"Vom Fischer und seiner Frau\" by Otmar Schoeck, at the Grachtenfestival Amsterdam. In November 2014, Sven performed \u201cDover Beach\u201d by Samuel Barber live for NPO4. In January 2015 he sang the role of Bartolo in a production of Le Nozze de Figaro at the Dutch National Opera Academy, and the role of Don Alfonso in Cosi fan Tutte in Festival Opera Aan Zee. He also sang the part of Moses in C.P.E. Bach\u2019s \u201cIsraelieten in der W\u00fcste\", the bass arias in J.S. Bach\u2019s Christmas Oratorio, the baritone soli in the Faur\u00e9\u201ds Requiem and in the 9th Symphony of Beethoven.

By the development from natural horn to valve horn, what becomes possible? \r\n\r\nSummary of Results: This paper examines the transition from natural horn to valve horn. There were many changes in this instrument in the 19th century, including different valve designs. Using analysis of compositions using both natural and valve horn it answers the questions: Why were there changes? What did this make possible for the player? What did this make possible for the composer? What are the advantages of each? The paper concludes that, although the natural horn is the ancestor of the modern horn, they remain different instruments for different musical purposes, often used together in a single composition. And modern horn players should be able to play both. The paper concludes with interviews of hornists who perform music from this period of transition, giving their views on the instruments.\r\nIn the 18th century they coexisted, showing the advantages of each of them. The natural horn has a more open sound and it blends very easily with woodwinds and brass and each key of crooks gets different colors. During the early times of its use many people didn\u2019t accept the valve system because they thought the natural horn was a more complete instrument and the sound of valve horn was not complete and was not clear. But many composers used the valve horn in their pieces, so the role of the valve horn became very important. Reasons were that the natural horn couldn\u2019t be played in the low register and with full dynamics. And because of hand techniques, the natural horn was difficult to play in chromatic scales and with large intervals and so on. So, the natural horn was replaced by the valve horn in many pieces.\r\n\r\nBiography: I started to learn the piano when I was 8. My piano teacher\u2019s daughter studied the horn at the College of music. My teacher suggested me to play the horn. The sound of the horn was pleased me. After deciding to start, I attended the arts middle school at the age of 13. I improved my musical talent by participating in wood quintet, brass quintet and an orchestra. Naturally, I moved on to attend a fine arts high school. I also learned various non-technical aspects of music such as musical theory and history through my high school curriculum. I participated in many competitions and also was a part of many different orchestras. At 18, I went to perform with my high school orchestra at Musikverein in Austria. It was unforgettable and I gained such a valuable experience from it."}, {"id": 256565, "type": "exposition", "title": "The influences of John Coltrane in Kenny Garrett's style of improvisation", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/256565/256566", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=256565", "keywords": [], "created": "03/03/2016", "last-modified": 1471946945, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "23/08/2016", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 99875, "name": "Manvydas Pratkelis"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Manvydas Pratkelis\r\nMain Subject: Jazz Saxophone \r\nResearch Supervisor: Patrick Schenkius\r\nTitle of Research:\r\nThe influences of John Coltrane in Kenny Garret\u2019s style of improvisation\r\nResearch Question:\r\nWhich improvisation techniques did Kenny Garrett take from John Coltrane and what did he do to adopt these techniques to his own improvisation on the alto saxophone\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe main reason of this research is to learn about the major influential aspects of alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett\u2019s improvisation, which he adopted from studying tenor saxophonist John Coltrane\u2019s improvisation, and how he uses it on alto saxophone.\r\nThis does not mean that John Coltrane was his only influence, as there is no doubt that Garrett studied a lot of Charlie Parker\u2019s improvisation and that of many more jazz musicians.

He defines music with the help of contemporary thinker R. Welten as more than a phenomenon that can be accurately described in a purely scientific way, but as something that transcends it because it has the ability to move, to affect people. Consequently he studies passages from the philosophical works of the writers F.W.J. Schelling (1775-1854), A. Schopenhauer (1788-1860) and H. Cohen (1842-1918), who all gave musical art a fundamental role in their philosophical reflections. The author comes to the conclusion that all thinkers agree in their own way on the idea that \u2018true\u2019 musical art originates in the mastery of strict forms (e.g. harmony, or musical styles such as fugues or dances) and the overcoming of these forms without losing freedom. In the last part of the paper, this temporary conclusion is put to the test in existing music, namely J.S. Bach\u2019s Ouvert\u00fcre nach Franz\u00f6sischer Art and Goldberg variations. In these works, the author sees a confirmation of his temporary conclusion in the way Bach merges the forms of strict counterpoint and rich harmony with the forms of the different French dances, and in the limiting boundaries the overarching idea behind the Goldberg variations imposes without limiting the expressiveness of the work. As a final conclusion, the author states that the use of philosophical concepts in musical reality can be challenging since thinking about music often seems farfetched from musical reality, but that this research shows that philosophy can help to shed some light on one of mankind\u2019s many mysteries: the beauty of music.\r\nBiography:\r\nAljosja Mietus (The Netherlands, 1990) received his first piano lessons when he was eight years old, but switched to the harpsichord at the age of twelve, having lessons with Menno van Delft and later with Tilman Gey.

Listening to recordings is a wonderful way of obtaining musical ideas from the talented musicians around the world. However, I realized that when one listens to a music without knowing the music beforehand, it is difficult to understand the diverse interpretation of the music from any of the YouTube videos. This pitiful fact led me to a question: What should I do to listen with more analytical ability to obtain broaden and diverse interpretation from recordings?\r\n\r\nThe research is made with comparative analysis of performances by four pianists, Emil Giles, Claudio Arrau, Dmitry Masleev, and Alfred Brendel, on Beethoven\u2019s piano sonata \u201cdas Lebewohl\u201d to improve pianist\u2019s analytical listening skill. To understand diverse interpretation contained in performances of four pianists, basic knowledge of this sonata including musical analysis and historical background is presented prior to analysis of performances.\r\n\r\nComparative analysis of performance is categorized to five main sections: Theme development, articulation, pedal usage, tempo flexibility and phrasing. In the end of analysis, one can easily witness Gilels showing clean and stable performance in general. Arrau shows the most clear and motivic transformation amongst the four. Masleev stands out with playing the most even performance. Last but not least, Brendel best demonstrates his personal understandings through a whole piece.\r\n\r\nTo improve analytical listening skill through analysis of four performances, one should be able to apply the process of analyzing the performance which is used in this research to one\u2019s own studies. The process consists of four steps: Obtaining basic knowledge of music, categorizing the things to look out for when listening, comparing their recordings according to the categories in the second point and applying what you have acquired to your own playing.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nJihee Min was born in South Korea in 1990.

So when later given the opportunity to undertake a Masters Research project, I immediately knew my research question: \"How does one to become the ultimate sideman as a jazz drummer?\" This is not an easy question, and I think that in my book the answer is hidden behind the story. The main part of my book consists of two long interviews I did with the American soprano/tenor saxophonist and educator, David Liebman. Prior to these interviews I wrote roughly one hundred portraits of the musicians I've played with and the experiences I've had with them both on and off stage. I sent these writings to David, who used them to compile some very interesting questions on which we based the interviews. The first interview was conducted in 2009 and the second in 2010. Alongside the interviews, all of my portraits were also published in the book. From these interviews/conversations emerged the topics of influences, awareness of certain styles, the quarter note groove, interaction, and how to deal as a drummer with different soloist's varying approaches to the time-feel. I wrote this book especially for young and upcoming jazz drummers/students to give them some insight into real life situations through the eyes of an experienced drummer/sideman. There are hundreds of books written with great drum exercises, and I felt that another book of exercises would not add anything more to what is already available on the market. In order to collect extra feedback and to have points of comparison from the careers of my drummer colleagues, I also conducted interviews with two other well-known ultimate sidemen, Adam Nussbaum from New York and Joe LaBarbera from Los Angeles. These two interviews can be found in appendices i and ii. \r\n\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nEric Ineke started his career in the sixties. Drummers like Philly Joe Jones and Elvin Jones were his inspiration. In 1969 he made his first record with Ferdinand Povel. From the seventies on Eric played in the legendary Rein de Graaff/Dick Vennik Quartet, The Ben van den Dungen/Jarmo Hoogendijk Quintet and The Piet Noordijk Quartet. During his career he recorded numerous CD\u2019s and toured with many great American jazz musicians like Dexter Gordon, Johnny Griffin, George Coleman, Al Cohn, Jimmy Raney, Barry Harris, Eric Alexander and David Liebman. For more then 40 years he is a member of the Rein de Graaff Trio and appeared on numerous jazzfestivals like Nice, Pescara, San Remo, Athens, Toronto, Montreal and New York. Since 2006 he is leading The Eric Ineke JazzXpress, a swinging band in the hardbop tradition. In 2012 he published his first book \u2018\u2019 The Ultimate Sideman\u2019\u2019, which he wrote together with David Liebman, for Pincio Publishers.

The research project about the Piccolo Flute, presented in this Research Paper, was developed in order to tell a story through the music, exploring its sounds and techniques, and creating sound metaphors to express emotions. Zephyrus, the west wind God, blows different kinds of wind and can be used as archetypes for many emotional states and affects.

Singable picture books can have many positive effects on the singing voice, linguistic and reading skills, improvisation skills, social skills and narrative skills. Singable picture books can become a ritual and a moment of concentration in the lesson. It is an attractive way to present and prepare a song for the children. \r\nFolk songs are very suitable for singable picture books because of their narrative character. The children will have a more lively experience by looking at the story while singing or listening to a song. \r\nIn this study I will explore the benefits of using singing and illustrations combined in a picture book. Also I have made a list with criteria what makes a good singable picture book. \r\nIn the Netherlands there are not many singable picture books. I have made two books with a folk song in Dutch and a musical activity suitable for age 4-7. These books are meant for music specialists, but can also be used in other lessons or at home.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nLiterature study about the benefits of using singable picture books: singing voice, folk songs, picture books, multisensory learning, reading and linguistic development.\r\nPractice based study: analysis of the singable picture books by trying them out in the music lessons, and write down features of the songs, books, and illustrations.\r\nCriteria list: based on my findings according to this analysis, what works well?

The violin is a melodic instrument; traditionally we primarily work on the violin solo part of the pieces during lessons, focussing sometimes mainly on technical difficulties, which leads to a poor understanding of the music that is being played. The goal in this case is working towards the achievement of polyphonic hearing, that will enable the students to understand in a deeper level the pieces of their repertoire regarding form, phrasing, harmony/polyphony, rhythm and articulation; therefore allowing them to be independent musicians that can make their own musical decisions when playing. I have designed a series of activities related to different pieces of the violin repertoire \u2013 from beginners to advanced \u2013 using movement, singing, relative solfa and improvisation on the instrument. These activities work as well as a bridge between the general musicianship lessons and the violin lessons.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nEstela Benita Bern\u00e9s is a violin player and teacher from the area of Barcelona, Spain.

Made clear is that jazz, alien at first, became and integral part of the European landscape. Examples are given that once jazz was integrated into the music culture of Europe, jazz musicians in Europe made major contributions to all further new developments in jazz. \r\nWhat this paper also makes clear is that around 1977 and 2007 the cultural landscape had gone through such paradigm shifts that one can speak of three distinctive periods. \r\nA clear as possible focus on jazz as music is obtained by not primarily focusing on what \u2018great\u2019 men did, not on where exactly in Europe special events took place, nor on exact dates.\r\nThe history of jazz in Europe presented in this paper is conceived in such a way that it serves as an opening chorus, as an invitation to improvise upon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nWouter Turkenburg, (Singapore, 1953) studied classical guitar at the Conservatory of Arnhem, musicology at the University of Amsterdam, is founder of the World Music School of the Music Lyceum in Amsterdam and became head of the jazz department and teacher of jazz history at the Royal Conservatory, The Hague, The Netherlands.

Way of being interpreted.\r\n\r\nResearch question: Why did Pablo Sarasate compose the first dance of the Caprice Basque in 3/4 bar?\r\n\r\nSummary of results:\r\n\r\nThe first dance of the \"Caprice Basque\" op. 24 by Pablo Sarasate is composed in 3/4 although it is a traditional dance from Basque Country which is usually played in 5/8. The piece was composed in 1880 when the quintuple bars were not still common at the classical occidental musical language but they were beginning to be spread little by little. After having analyzed all the documentation about it, my conclusion is that in the folkloric music often the musicians do not play what is written in the score really precisely. Sometimes what is written in the score is just an approximation of what it sounds.  Is at the second half of the XIX, when, the folkloric music gets analyzed by expert musicians, that we start to see the relation between what we listen and what we read in the scores. This is exactly the case of Pablo Sarasate. He knew about the 5/8 bar when he composed the Caprice Basque ( because of the geographical closeness of Pamplona (his hometown) and the Basque Country, and because there were in the Basque tradition some written 5/8 \u201cZortziko\u201d examples as the one we have seen of 1813 by Antonia de Mazarredo or her sister Juana de Mazarredo) but despite he wrote it in 3/4, it is completely sure that he would interpret it in the traditional way. Attached we can see a transcription of the piece in 5/8 which shows how the \"Caprice Basque\" op. 24 should sound.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nMikel Iba\u00f1ez, violinist.

Many modern performers however are unaware of Servais\u2019s numerous and important contributions to the history of cello construction, playing style, and technique. After a brief overview of notable cellists (including Duport, Romberg, and Dotzauer) and playing techniques (including vibrato, portamento, and bow-holds) that coexisted at the beginning of the 19th century, this research paper goes on to examine Servais\u2019s life and work as an independent concert artist. While Servais did not leave behind any methods or treatises, a close study of contemporaneous accounts of his playing style, technique, instrument preferences, concert programs, and his association with many of the leading composers of his day reveals his enduring contributions to the rise of the cello as a vehicle for the new Romantic virtuoso style. Most notable among these contributions were his standardization of the use of the endpin, his wide-ranging and successful career as a touring performer, and the invaluable impression he left on the younger generation of cellist-composers (including Davidov and Popper). It is however an in-depth analysis of his Fantaisie 'Souvenir de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg' Op. 15 that ultimately reveals the most revolutionary and innovative aspects of his technique and playing style: from his fingering, shifting, and use of harmonics, to his bowing, phrasing, articulation, arpeggiation, use of thumb position, and extroverted approach - elements that have all gone on to form the basis of modern cello playing. During my presentation I intend to provide an overview of these findings, and to demonstrate evidence of Servais's technical and stylistic achievements as revealed by his Fantaisie Op. 15 on my own instrument.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nAurore Montaulieu is a French cellist.

Their complete composition covered practically his entire lifetime, from 1766 to 1791 and some of them were originated in actual improvisatory performances. Considering also the historically documented connections between the variation genre and the extemporization practices, this research is focused on their study as models for learning improvisation on the Classical style. With this purpose, I am using a concrete methodology that is being developed now in Spain (IEM methodology) that places the improvisation in the core of music education, with special emphasis in the use of patterns extracted from the musical sources. This has been combined with the historically informed performance practice in order to develop a repertory of exercises and proposals to be used as a guided practice for this learning process.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nJuan Manuel Cisneros (M\u00e1laga, Spain, 1978) is pianist, composer and teacher.

By setting the plots of the four independent entr\u00e9es in real but geographically distant cultures, the librettist Louis Fuzelier was able to introduce new spectacles to the operatic stage, providing novelty for audiences jaded by the tradition of entertainment based on gods and mythology. This dramatic development in turn provided Rameau with the opportunity to manipulate and extend the musical conventions of the time in order to create a style of expression appropriate to depict these exotic characters and locales. A deeper understanding of the context in which Rameau and Fuzelier created this work was has further revealed that the libretto and Rameau\u2019s musical depiction of the characters in Les Incas du P\u00e9rou and Les Sauvages reflect the practice in early Enlightenment literary and philosophical cirlces of idealising exotic cultures to criticise eighteenth century French society. These conclusions offer modern performers a wider range of interpretive options when approaching this work, allowing for a more nuanced performance which brings together the elements of drama, music, philosophy and entertainment in a cohesive manner.\r\n\r\nBiography: Australian soprano Bethany Shepherd studied Classical Singing at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, under renowned Wagnerian soprano Lisa Gasteen.

This paper investigates the way in which the different positions of holding the instrument could change the sound of it. After studying at sources and making experiments with different posture it can be confirmed that that the sound changes with different ways of holding the violin. The technique and interpretation are also affected. The main conclusion is that violin technique is not unchangeable.

Looking at the writings of Stravinsky and Schoenberg teaches us that there are different ideas about the role a performer should have. Stravinsky would ideally have a performer execute music and not \u2018interpret\u2019 it, while Schoenberg expects more expressive input from the performer. However, we have also seen that Stravinsky\u2019s allergy against \u2018interpretation\u2019 probably stems from bad experiences with performers interpreting his music the wrong way. Present-day performers agree that his music \u2013 or any music, for that matter: the same principles apply to music of all ages \u2013 does need to be interpreted by the performer, but in the correct style.\r\n\r\nInterpretation of a score is not an exact science. However, that does not mean it cannot go wrong. The prime directive of interpretation is that it should not go against the literal text of the score. Since notation is almost never complete, other methods of interpretation can be used to fill in the gaps. When textual interpretation does not provide enough information, the performer can resort to contextual interpretation: the context of the piece (e.g. sung text, or a structural analysis) or the context of the composer\u2019s work in general, i.e. his style, or language. Other methods that can be used in connection with these basic types of interpretation include speaking with the composer or listening to recordings of the composer or with the composer\u2019s approval. This last method can be problematic, since more information is always required on the value a particular recording should have: is this exactly what the composer intended or is it just acceptable to the composer within the boundaries they set?\r\n\r\nAll performers I spoke with agreed that the final step a performer should take is to make the music their own. This may seem in contradiction with the principle that a performer should always aim to reproduce the composer\u2019s wishes; a principle that we perhaps inherited from Stravinsky. However, it makes sense when you think about it. When performing a piece, you automatically interpret the score using whatever methods are appropriate when you decide for yourself what the composer must have had in mind when he wrote it down. When you have uncovered this interpretation, and have learned the language of the composer, you must then speak this language to convey the composer\u2019s story (as you interpret it) to the audience. That last line of communication is something entirely in the hands of the performer and that automatically \u201cimplicates the performer\u2019s personality\u201d, as Reinbert de Leeuw puts it. This is not problematic or contradictory, as long as the performer, when speaking the language, always remains faithful to the will of the composer.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nPieter van Loenen is a Dutch violinist who graduated his bachelor\u2019s cum laude at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague as a student of Vera Beths.

Body language is, next to singing, an equally important communication tool for singers on stage. It shows knowledge of the movements of the body and understanding of the role or character. The libretto can be translated into body language, so the audience can understand it without knowing exactly what text is sung. It can be concluded that all body parts can be chosen to show a certain mood which fits within the role or character. Gestures do not have to be over- exaggerated, because the audience is able to see and interpret small signs, even from a distance. Consciously chosen body language is easier to decode than spontaneous body language and can be more convincing, even though the singer is not in that certain\r\nmood. Body language is part of the luggage of a singer and a tool for showing his expression and intentions.\r\nI chose for the form of a research paper, because I would like to share new or expanded knowledge with my colleagues by doing an in-depth research.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nCharlotte (1991) takes part in Studio 32, an opera studio of her teacher Henny Diemer.

Pianists in the same generation as I am also may have had such the experience of hearing that their teacher say, \u201cDon\u2019t play arpeggio when the composer doesn\u2019t indicate it\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t break your right and left hand\u201d.\r\nSuch a strict attitude to the un-notated arpeggio originates from the tendency that the musicology (and musicians) in the late 20th century considered the intentions of composers as the most important thing, and they attributed it to the authentic score like manuscripts, or a first edition. In such a mood, it was not \u201cauthentic\u201d to add un-notated arpeggios. Playing un-notated arpeggios was a symbol of over romanticism, and sloppy playing. But there is much evidence that composers themselves added arpeggios, even if they show a strict attitude to the un-notated arpeggio in their remarks.\r\nIf we look at the treaties, we can see that the un-notated arpeggio has a long tradition from the Baroque and Classical period. It is not a symbol of over-romanticism in the late 19th century, but a tactical tool to express character and affect of pieces.\r\nFrom the remarks of treaties, and early recordings of first half of 20th century, we can see that the character and affect of a piece is a very important element to decide, whether we can use arpeggio or not. Especially in the slow, expressive pieces or sections of a pieces we have many opportunities to add arpeggio.\r\nIf we consider the tradition and usefulness of un-notated arpeggio, we should feel free to use it, especially on historical keyboard instruments.\r\nBiography:\r\nBorn in Tokyo, Mariko Goto started her modern piano studies in her earliest childhood.

Elaborate research has been done on the connection between movement (gesture) and intention (meaning) in spoken language. The same principles and findings in these studies can be applied to movement and its connection to music. The method described in my case study, in which I studied Lera Auerbach\u2019s Lonely Suite for violin solo while focusing on my body\u2019s impulses, makes use of this instinctual way of showing what we feel, and therefore leads to a sincere and convincing interpretation. In so doing, this process can be very clarifying for a performer.\r\nBased on my research into the available background literature I can conclude that there is much to be gained by using conscious movement while learning and performing a piece of music. Indeed, various authors repeatedly emphasize the importance of this subject for musicians, and their hope that it will be further researched and developed within the context of musical performance. By way of my case study, I have indeed found that using movement provides a new approach to learning a piece of music and to developing a personal, sincere, and honest interpretation. Emerging from the unconscious, I strongly believe that an interpretation that has been reached through movement will translate strongest to a given audience.\r\nThe background sources surveyed have also proven the value of a movement-based approach for audiences. In addition to the obvious benefits for the performer as related to musical meaning and expression, benefits that are then shared by the audience, there is also the visual aspect of this approach to performing music with conscious movements: an aspect that is of great value when connecting, sharing, and communicating with audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nIsa Goldschmeding studied with Axel Strauss at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and with Theodora Geraets and Ilona Sie Dhian Ho at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague.

Nevertheless due to the writers' lack of ability to play the drums the existing research is very unsatisfying from a jazz drummer's perspective. Based on a wide array of transcriptions I put together several methods and concepts for accompaniment as well as drum solos developed by Elvin Jones. I also identified two predecessors to specfic stylistic approaches. The second chapter is about Jack Dejohnette, Jeff 'Tain' Watts and Brian Blade and how they dealt with his heritage.\r\nMy main conclusion is that aspects of Elvin's style especially the method of 'play the drum set as one instrument' completely changed the approach of playing the drums in Jazz. Specific characteristics can be found in the better part of contemporary jazz drummers and therefore it is essential to deal with his concepts and ideas. This research helped me to increase my awareness of various stylistics of modern jazz drum set playing and at the same time I got an idea on how to apply those methods.\r\n\r\nCV:\r\n\r\nPeter Primus Frosch (drums)\r\nborn on the 11.12.1990\r\n\r\nHe started playing drums at age 5.

Which different effects it would have on different fingerings? What\u2019s the modern solution of fingerings and its influence?\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe Viennese Double Bass was a dominant type of double bass used in the Classical Period in Vienna. It usually has 5 string, tuned in F1-A1-D-F#-A, with frets. Unfortunately, we can barely find any historical material that was written down on the fingering of this instrument. Through the analysis of the history of fingerings on various double basses documented in historical methods, I can find the pattern of fingering that is often related to the tuning intervals of the instrument. The Viennese double bass was possibly using a '1-2-4' fingering system. In my research paper, I give the suggestions of specific fingerings, including basic fingerings (scales, arpeggios), exception fingerings (chordal fingering, octave fingering). For octaves, I find the possible solutions by using basic, chordal, extension fingerings and shifting strategy. With excerpts of solo works and orchestral parts, I give further explanation of the fingerings. Finally, I try to point out that the modern tuning of the Viennese double bass could cause alteration of the historical fingerings. Furthermore, it would also change the timbre.\r\nBiography:\r\nMaster student of Violone (Koninklijk Conservatorium, Den Haag)\r\nArtist Diploma of Double Bass (China Central Conservatory, Beijing)\r\nMaster Degree of Journalism (Tsinghua University, Beijing)"}, {"id": 104046, "type": "exposition", "title": "A Study of Basso Continuo Instrumentation in Baroque Cello Sonatas With a Focus on Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/104046/104047", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=104046", "keywords": ["intrumentation", "Basso Continuo", "Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re"], "created": "28/10/2014", "last-modified": 1465826074, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "13/06/2016", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 99850, "name": "Evan Buttar"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Main Subject: Baroque Cello\r\n\r\nResearch Coach: Johannes Boer\r\n\r\nResearch Question: What basso continuo instrumentation possibilities exist in baroque cello sonatas, and specifically in the works of Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re?\r\n\r\nBasso continuo is an essential part of baroque music, but the instrumentation of it is often ignored or dismissed. All too often, modern performers play with harpsichord and cello without considering the other options. This research paper investigates what the most common instrumentations for the basso continuo were in France and Italy, as well as what exceptions were made. The goal of the paper is to have a better understanding as to what instrument combinations can be added to baroque cello sonatas, and specifically to those of Jean-Baptiste Barri\u00e8re. This composer was chosen because of the inventiveness, virtuosity, and unique nature of his music. Since there is little evidence relating directly to the cello, the continuo groups in orchestral, chamber, and solo music are investigated. The sources used include treatises and instrument manuals from the time, indications in the scores, records of basso continuo groups in concerts, and the opinions of present scholars on the subject. This information is then applied to practice through a series of instrumentation experiments on sonatas of Barri\u00e8re, with a second cello, double bass, archlute, guitar, and harpsichord.

However, according to recent studies, this approach using an internal focus (focus directed to the movement itself) tends to be less effective than using an external focus (focus directed to the effect of the movement on the environment). \r\nTherefore the second approach consists in anticipating the sound as an external focus as well as developing the geography of the instrument.

Consequently the last approach is related to the goal conception as well as the practice of the musical intention. \r\nMy main conclusion is that musical intention should be the main concern of the artist in his practice, which will lead to a more authentic approach in his artistic development. Besides, I encourage musicians to use goal setting in their daily practice to develop awareness of their intention, which will help to have a better view of what method to use to reach the desired result.

This research has sought to find some of the causes and some of the possible actions to take in response. Through an extensive questionnaire and interviews with experts a number of ideas were found concerning the possible causes and various means to help those in crisis. It was found that it is important in the first years: to have free choice of instrument, to start playing and receiving lessons early, to have support in the decision to attend higher education in music. In the years of study it is important, among other things, to establish good practice habits, including an early start and more than one warm-up per day. A maximum of 4 hours practice per day and one free day per week are recommended. During the professional years discipline remains essential, and teaching trombone is strongly associated with not developing problems. Recommendations from the experts interviewed include: place focus on the music, never on the physical problems; always keep learning; let go of patterns and judgements; increase your awareness through breathing; be open and honest; stay in contact with yourself.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nPete Saunders began his career in Mexico.

This in order to improve my teaching and increase the learning outcomes of the students. Despite quite some development and improvement of lessons and material over the past 15 years I see too many students having trouble combining theory and practice. Exactly in this regard I assume that the Kod\u00e1ly concept can offer great positive effect. Since 2009 I have become practically acquainted with the Kod\u00e1ly concept through several workshops, courses and 4 visits to primary schools in Hungary.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective as a jazz musician and theory teacher the Kod\u00e1ly concept offers many valuable aspects that I will integrate: a good balance between experiencing music, musicianship skills and music theory. The musical experience is based on singing (in tune), the basic theoretical understanding is provided by solmization often combined with hand signs, and the musical material is original repertoire of master composers.\r\n\r\nSince the Kod\u00e1ly concept is mainly focussing on folk and classical art music, there is a challenge in applying the teaching elements to jazz music. The main research questions are:\r\nThe practicality of solmization and hand signs regarding the high degree of chromaticism in melody and harmony as well as tempo in jazz music\r\nTo find a form for the lesson in which improvisation and playing and are integrated as well\r\nThe research will be practice based in testing the learning material and activities with jazz students.\r\nThe material and experiences of this practice-based research will lead to a workbook for students and a teacher's manual in June 2015.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research are manifold. It has become clear for me that it is possible to teach jazz inspired by the Kod\u00e1ly concept. As a teacher the change of approach is more challenging than I expected and at times it feels like a transformation. As such it is work in progress, much more has to be done.

And does the application of the directional approach provide an effective navigation tool for the improviser while shaping the harmony? \u2028\r\n\r\nSummary of results:\r\nThe navigation system can help in the choice of logical harmonic progressions while improvising. As a navigation tool it allows harmonic movement to be felt as opposed to calculated. As a tool for invention, the arrows challenge the obvious progressions one makes habitually as an improviser and one develops a sense of the basic movements in harmony: prolongation, movement and consolidation. It is clear that a simpler organization of harmony in the improviser's mind stimulates an active imagination, stands less in the way of the creative process, and leaves more time to anticipate what lies ahead. The research experiences have reconfirmed the importance of playing with one's ears wide open while improvising. As a teaching tool the directional approach is promising, although new materials have to be developed. This is work in progress. Clearly this research is not finished here. The next step is to take the results as a starting point for changes in the teaching of improvisation. One wish is to integrate the directional ideas with certain elements from the Partimento tradition. Then there is further research needed on the relationship between the upper structures and the underlying fundamental melody, dealing with stylistic elements such as chord forms and voice leading.

This was the initial experience that changed my whole teaching and also my view on Music Education in general. After several study tours to Hungary I was convinced that it would be possible to develop a Kod\u00e1ly-inspired Music curriculum for Dutch elementary schools. Musical skills should and can be taught to anyone, beginning already in elementary school and not only at conservatoire level. As Kod\u00e1ly puts it: \u201cLet music belong to everyone\u201d.\r\n\r\nSinging musical repertoire is the fundament of all Kod\u00e1ly-inspired music teaching. So I began collecting relevant repertoire for Kod\u00e1ly-inspired music lessons in Dutch elementary schools: songs, rhymes, singing games, (folk) dances, canons, quodlibets, etc.\r\n\r\nTo answer the research question I have collected many Dutch and International song books for elementary school from past to present and went through them for closer musical analysis. Besides, I researched song material at the Meertens Institute Amsterdam, organized a (folk) dancing workshop for elementary school teachers and went on study tours to Budapest and Glasgow. And of course I took notice of the repertoire that my fellow Kod\u00e1ly-colleagues at the Royal Conservatoire (KC) used. Searching and collecting repertoire became an attitude. \r\n\r\nBut searching repertoire is not a theoretical business. Therefore, in the last two years I was testing repertoire in some of my classes: 1) Jong-KC-junior-students of the Royal Conservatoire at the age of 7-9 years; these children were following a special talent education. 2) \u2018Normal\u2019 children of the age of 6-8 years at a local Dutch elementary school. \r\n\r\nTo gather the repertoire I built a database in File Maker Pro. I analysed the repertoire concerning musical parameters that are relevant to build a curriculum for Music education. The advantage of such a database is the fact that it is searchable. So when building a curriculum, repertoire can be grouped and sequenced according to the musical learning goals that are aimed at.

However, this endeavor resulted in many secondary\r\nrealizations. Firstly, the very concept of \u201cplaying from memory\u201d has evolved from being\r\na process that pursues the interiorization of the rhythmic and melodic figures that\r\ncompose what we call music (playing without any physical memory aid) to a much more\r\nemotional, even spiritual involvement of one\u2019s consciousness with the message the\r\nparticular music tries to convey, its content and not just its form. This it to say that to\r\nknow the very essence of what a musical excerpt stands for as well as its context is a\r\nmuch more powerful method than to simply learn it by memory: it is playing it by heart.\r\nAlthough the PbH memorization model was designed to improve performance, the\r\nobtained results revealed that while this method sharply boosts such traits as focus and\r\naccuracy y (which make for better music), it may have damaged other aspects of\r\nperforming that require an external; awareness, like a performer\u2019s presence on stage for\r\nexample. Another interesting effect of this research was its lack of selectivity. This means\r\nthat although the performer tried to apply the PbH memorization model to a select\r\nnumber of excerpts, the method\u2019s nature (as well as the performer\u2019s brain\u2019s nature) made\r\nit impossible to avoid some of its principles to bleed into other excerpts, which were not\r\nmeant to be affected. The Playing by Heart memorization model is considered applicable\r\nand useful in learning and performing trumpet orchestral excerpts.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nInes Serrano Diogo was born in Portimao, Portugal, and started playing the trumpet by\r\nthe age of 8.

My criteria for this selection are the following:\r\nWhich songs have become part of the standard repertoire in jazz, performed by various\r\nartists throughout the 20th (and 21st) century? Where can I find aural trademarks, which I\r\nrecognize both as a listener and as a player and which contribute to my personal\r\nperception of the \u201cStrayhorn sound\u201d?

Is it important whether or not the\r\nmusician paints his / her piece in an abstract style or a representational / figurative style?\r\nWhat is the importance of colour and form to the musician?\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nAt the end of the Eighteenth Century, the Romantic movement began to spread across\r\nEurope and revolutionise the expression of The Arts. The overall aim of The Arts shifted\r\nfrom one of mere imitation to one which projected intense emotions and consequently,\r\nsince then, a strong interdependence between music and painting has existed. This study\r\nexplores the ways in which painting can be most beneficial to the musician. Having first\r\nresearched existing key theories relating to music and painting including: Nietzsche's\r\nphilosophy, which calls for music to always have a pictorial counterpart to be fully\r\ncomprehended. The suggestion from Zelter that the musician/composer that paints or the\r\nartist that composes/ plays music has a greater potential to become the 'best genuine\r\nartist'. There have been numerous attempts to synthesize the two Art Forms: tone poems,\r\nsound sculptures, kinetic paintings and the ultimate Gesamtkunstwerk.\r\nFrom these and other theories key topics have emerged including:\r\n- The Boundaries and Characteristics of Music and Painting.\r\n- Music and Colour.\r\n- Abstract Painting vs Figurative Painting and The Musician.\r\nThe research has found colour can help the musician discover the structure of the music\r\nand highlight keynotes, intervals or link together movements of a larger work. Abstract\r\nPainting allows direct comparisons to be made to music linking line and colour with\r\nrhythm and tone. Figurative Painting allows the musician to summarise the overall\r\ncharacter of a piece through personal association. Music becomes tangible. The\r\npresentation will look further in depth at the above 3 key topics and through examples\r\naim to demonstrate the power of painting and music in combination.\r\nBiography:\r\nAlice Thompson has been living and studying in The Hague since September 2012.

Translated it means: union of body and mind, and even from this translation one can immediately make connections with the aspirations of a musician.

Why?  For one main reason.  My research is based on Hatha Yoga and two of its eight limbs (elements) are asanas (physical postures) and pranayama (breath control).  Posture and breathing are at the core of every flautists technique, with both having equal influence on the sound produced, more so than any other instrument.  In this presentation we shall explore these two limbs as I have, and whether specific asanas and pranayama exercises can be shown to be particularly beneficial to flautists.  As a flautist who has been struggling with negative comments on posture for years, yoga has been a revelation for me and I wanted to bring this to others, however making it more accessible, relevant and easy for anyone to include as part of their practice.\r\nAdditionally we shall look into the three other limbs my research covered: pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from objects); dharana (concentration); and niyama (observances) and how my general day-to-day life and practice as a flautist and musician has improved through my research of them.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nElizabeth Marr, born in Aberdeen, graduated with a First Class Honours BMus Degree and LTCL with Distinction from TrinityLaban CMD in London (2013) studying flute with Anna Noakes, Margaret Campbell and Alan Baker (piccolo).

The painting is projected on a large screen behind the musicians, in live classical concerts. Because the watercolours are flowing and the paintbrush is moving, it is called \u201ckinetic\u201d painting, which means \u201cmoving\u201d. This artist developed the art form of kinetic painting on music for almost forty years, and performed with famous orchestra's, conductors and musicians all over the world. The late violinist Yehudi Menuhin called him \u201ca musician, who makes music with his brush\u201d. His aim is to enhance the music with his kinetic painting.\r\n\tWhen I saw for the first time a live performance of him, together with a clarinettist, I was very surprised about the way that visual arts and music were brought together, and how that led me to a deeper experience of the music. Although not everyone will have this same experience (some others will experience the painting as detracting), I wanted to research how it can be that his kinetic painting is able to enhance the experience of music for some people, including for me.\r\n\tTo come to an understanding of this, I studied the historical context of the combination of visual art and music, and I pointed out the role of synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in another sensory. In this case it means that some people automatically see colours when they hear music. Perryman is using this phenomenon in some way in his paintings.\r\n\tAn interview with Norman Perryman in his atelier in Amsterdam helped me to come to an understanding of the methods that he is using to paint with classical music. The reason that the kinetic painting is able to lead to a deeper experience can be because of some correspondences between classical music and Perryman's kinetic painting. For example: He intentionally uses an analogue art form, to let it correspond with the purity of the acoustic sound in classical music.  Another resemblance is that Perryman does not improvise on the music, but he prepares his compositions carefully; like a classical piece is composed and not improvised, or like a choreography is designed, with an interplay and counterpoint between the musical lines. \r\n\tTo approach the subject from different angles (beside the context, my own experiences and the intentions of Perryman) I gathered some remarkable experiences that other people had with the kinetic painting of Perryman: some interviews with musicians that cooperated with him, some reviews of performances in the newspapers, and some responses that Perryman received after the concerts. \r\n \r\nBiography:\r\nAnja Brons was born in the Netherlands, in 1989. She started to play bassoon when she was 9 years old, and at the age of 19 she started to study bassoon at the conservatory in Groningen, in the prepatory year. In this same time she started a study at the Art Academy in Groningen, but after one year she decided to quit there, to be able to focus on the music study. She is still searching for ways to combine her passion for both music and visual arts.

This comes in light-shows, with pictures or a film-version of the\r\npiece on stage projected in the hall.\r\nPleasing the eye has always been an issue on the concert stage of course. It is essential to\r\nconsider how a performance should proceed and look like. But illustrating the music that\r\nis played in a concert has more consequences than only decorating the stage even a bit\r\nmore or making a bigger impression in the audience.\r\nIn my research paper, I document several formats of classical concert productions that\r\nused a visual interpretation in performance. In this case study I tried to figure out the\r\nfunction of screen and film on stage and their effect during the concerts. I summarized\r\nmy findings in a list of \u2018Do\u2019s & Dont\u2019s\u2019. This list I, or others might use in a project\r\nwhere there is the wish to give a visual form to an own interpretation of a piece.\r\nIn a second more theoretical part I shortly introduce music-historical background of the\r\nidea to illustrate classical music and the aesthetic discussion this idea rises.

Depending on a particular situation and occasion, such judgements may be more or less formal ranging from a post-concert discussion and a review in the newspaper, to a thoughts expressed in a mark or awarded prize in an examination context. As musicians and music-lovers are focussed on examining the quality of the music their whole productive career, we consider ourselves to be experts at it. But research has shown otherwise, and that even though many of us might be experts at assessing musical quality, we all are liable to biases. This purpose of this study is to determine if judgements of expert musical performances would be affected by non-musical attributes of perceived outspoken appearance of the performance. In the first part of my research existing theories on the subject will be explicated. In the second part of this research an own experiment and its findings will be discussed and in the third part the results will be held against the stories of professional performers and jury members. With this study I hope to broaden the field of research on this subject and enlighten musicians and music reviewers with our human unconscious flaws and biases when it comes to assessing such a complicated matter as high level performances in music.

I found that categorizing transcriptions and their main characteristics in\r\ncomparison to their original sources suggests immediately an interpretative guideline. For\r\nexample a textual and ideal independence from the original could suggest a more free\r\ninterpretation.

Some musicians are even far better in communicating on\r\ntheir instrument than communicating in real life. With this research I was not looking for\r\na way to replace language with music, but to be able to get inspiration out of something\r\nthat is not a primary source for musicians (such as music books, albums, teachers etc.).\r\nBy looking at just the words of a speech and their phonetic sounds, you will need to use\r\nan entirely different approach when you want to create music based on this. You will\r\ncome up with other melodies and rhythms than you usually would when you work out of\r\nyour musical idiom. Also the \u2018logical form\u2019 in blocks of 4 bars will be far less present as\r\na speech is not written in a logical amount of bars.\r\nAs a drummer you can play licks and tricks you have mastered in your practice\r\nenvironment, play what you have heard on albums or just play instinctively what you feel\r\nlike. Personally I wanted to create a method of maintaining a lot of freedom but yet\r\nhaving a certain way of building my grooves and solos. To avoid having to steer your\r\nmind with musical theory (play like a certain artist, play sixteenths, use dynamics, play a\r\ndrum roll etc.\u2026) I wanted to be able to play an idea in as many ways as possible. Using\r\nthe spoken language covers many difficult theory but yet a person speaks naturally\r\nwithout having to think about all this. Getting to have this natural instinct on your\r\ninstrument is difficult and subjective to ones opinion but it does lead to a very different\r\nway of composing solos and grooves. This research tells you about ways to use the\r\nspoken language as an inspiration on your instrument. It covers theory about how we can\r\nanalyze speech, which is then converted to a method to play this on drums.

It is the belief of this research\u2019s author that to fully complement\r\nthese concertos, the cadenzas performed within them should match the composer\u2019s style\r\nduring this specific period of time. It is the purpose of this research to identify this style\r\nand more specifically the composer\u2019s expectations of what a cadenza for his concertos\r\nshould accomplish. In order to do this, we will take a two part approach. The first one\r\nconsists of a detailed study of instructions on the performance cadenzas given by\r\nhistorical treatises that Mozart would have known, including among others those of\r\nLeopold Mozart and Johann Joachim Quantz. The second section looks at the cadenzas\r\nMozart himself wrote during this specific time of his life, including five piano concertos,\r\nand one later work, the Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, which represents the\r\nonly cadenza he ever wrote for a stringed instrument. The presentation will show in detail\r\nhow closely Mozart followed the historical instructions by Quantz et al. on performing\r\ncadenzas in specific examples of his musical writing as well as give some general\r\nrecommendations of adapting his style to the violin. This will be accompanied by\r\nselected recordings of Mozart\u2019s cadenzas for piano as well as a demonstration of a\r\npossible violin cadenza for one of his violin concertos.\r\nBiography:\r\nRafael Font Viera started his violin studies in Caracas, Venezuela.

And in that case how far did the Italian Violoncellists influence the practice of cello playing in the 18th-century England and how this reflects in the repertoire for the instrument?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results: During the 17th century in England, the violin family instruments were considered by many of the noblemen and royalty as the instrument of pubs, village parties and fair-musicians. But, with the London performances of Italian and French cellists during the 30s of the 18th century, the popularity of the cello as a solo instrument grew considerably. Anyway, the cello, the bass instrument of the violin family, was built and played in England some years before that happened. It was designated with a different name (bass violin) and built in a different length than our modern standard but I believe it is still the same instrument. In this paper we will explore the terminology for the cello in Britain and I will try to proof that a bass violin is actually a cello by comparing the characteristics of some instruments made in England during the late 17th and 18th century, and paintings of the time. \r\nI will go also through the music and cello methods written and published in London for solo cello during the 18th century and I will analyze for what kind of musician was that music targeting, and what are the common characteristics of it. The presentation will include musical examples.

This style is the basis\r\nof all new styles in modern Jazz, and this improvisational language is the starting point to\r\nthe further, more extended languages in jazz. So for all of us Jazz musicians its deeper\r\nunderstanding and implementing to our own playing is more than essential.\r\nI always found the way Paul Chambers plays the bebop language on the instrument\r\namazing. It's fluent, melodic, it has a natural flow and incredible variety, and the phrasing\r\nis really full of life. Since I knew he was among the first double bass players who entirely\r\nunderstood and transformed the bebop language for this instrument, it was logical to find\r\nhim and his playing as the key for further studies in a more detailed way.\r\nThe way to the deeper understanding in jazz is by making transcriptions. I have chosen a\r\nfew blues tunes that he had solos in, then some more, to see the differences and possible\r\nsimilarities as well. Blues tunes seemed ideal to start researching: jazz players play them\r\nin great numbers, in more tonalities than a usual standard tune. I also tried to find blues\r\nsolos of him in different tonalities, for comparison, in order to see how this factor can\r\nchange his playing.\r\nThe result of this research is better playing in not only the blues tunes, but in all bebop or\r\nstandard tunes as well for me. Even the analysis and the continuous listening to the\r\nmaterial gave a lot of ideas. Later on the development and the practice of the exercises\r\nalso helped to get closer to the language and to the practical use of the analysis. I used to\r\nrecord the concerts I play usually, and if I listen back my blues solo playing before I\r\nstarted researching it, the difference is quite clear.\r\nBiography:\r\nI was born in Budapest, Hungary.

Playing an instrument requires a lot of involvement from the body and the\r\nmind, and can be very demanding. Therefore a session of practice or performance needs\r\nto be well prepared if the musician needs to play a long time in order to avoid all the\r\nproblems that he can meet by the demands of practicing and performing.\r\nThere is no need to spend a very long time on the warm-up, but important to do it in a\r\ngood way, and in order to succeed in warming up it is good to have some knowledge\r\nabout why and how to do it.\r\nIn this presentation, we will approach the warm-up from the physical side and the mental\r\nside, without and with instrument.

I noticed that a lot of interesting harmony movements they used were utilizing symmetrical structures that were using tritone, major 3rd and minor 3rd intervals so I decided to try and combine various shapes in these intervals. While not having a deep understanding of harmony I realized that I have to explore this topic and therefore i started to explore the possible applications of a shape that I found to be appealing for my exploration - the triad. This piece of work is going to focus on the possible applications of the triad shape in jazz harmony utilizing topics like \"Reinterpretation\" And \"Tritone Key\". A couple of common harmony movements are going to be explored with possible triad combinations in tritone, major 3rd and minor 3rd intervals. And a couple of etudes to display an actual result that was achieved by utilizing this method. The chosen format is a Research Paper.

For me it was something like weight lifting training with the motto \u201cNo Pain, No Gain\u201d. This was my idea about practicing music for more than 15 years. Besides the hard work I was also dealing with anxiety and the outcome was that I was not progressing in my practice and performance. I noticed that I was not enjoying myself anymore as I did as a young boy, but that I was \u2018working\u2019 the trombone instead of \u2018playing\u2019. When I was accepted for the masters program of the conservatoire I knew I had to change something about my way of practicing. So I came up with my main question for my master research \u201cHow can I bring the joy back into my daily practice?\u201d In my research paper I am exploring the flow theory of Csikszentmihalyi and the use of awareness from book of The Inner Game of Music. According to the Csikszentmihalyi flow can help musicians to experience more joy and achieve better work satisfaction. In order to explore this theory and the use of awareness I used a case study, Keren by Iannis Xenakis. Because joy\r\nand anxiety also got a lot to do with how you plan your practice and recovery I also made a practice plan. For this I used the information and planning techniques I got from Erja Joukamo-Ampuja, one of the speakers at the conference \u2018From Potential to Performance\u2019 in 2013. Putting all the information I gained during my research together, I came up with six conditions that I needed for my daily practice to be flow-like so I could gain some joy out of it: having a clear mind, a goal/outcome, good skill/challenge match, frequent feedback, physical/mental energy, relaxed concentration. During my presentation I will explain the concepts of flow, anxiety and joy in my daily practice and my case study.\r\nBiography:\r\nThe Trombone came into Georgios\u2019 life at the age of 15, although he had started playing music at the age of ten in his local fanfare band.

The gathering between the latin and jazz gave birth year by year to a new form of music that would incorporate: the innovations and difficulties of the swing and jazz world that was evolving in the US; the solid groove foundations coming from southern America. The result that was made alive by people like Dizzy Gillespie, Chano Pozo and many others was simply unbelievable.\r\nThis latin tinge influence became more and more popular also in all the standards the american jazz players used to play and made them writing new compositions and arrangements using this new flavour. This book wants to go deep into the latin tinge grooves that made certain standards really peculiar and helped these songs to become something unforgettable drummingwise.\r\nThe groove is the core of the music so this work aims to demonstrate how simple ideas and rhythms played in the right spot and in the right tune are everything that is needed to make the music sound good. Every groove described wants to give the drummer a reference to expand his vocabulary starting from the solid foundations that the master drummers of the XX century offered.\r\nThe presntation will show how knowing history and the roots of the drumming is the most important thing to develop your own musical personality and in order to have a unique personality the basics and foundamentals of drumming should be really solid. The groove is the core and the latin tinge grooves are part of a chapter that no jazz drummer should underestimate.\r\nBiography: Jacopo Zanette (drums)\r\nMusician class '89, drummer, composer, teacher since 2010.Bachelor study in jazz drums and percussions at the Kartnerlandeskonservatorium of Klagenfurt(Austria)obtaining the degree cum laudae.In the same institute he studied musical pedagogy, obtaining a parallel degree also cum laudae.In 2010 records \u201cSong for Jaco\u201d with the Pordenone big band conducted by Juri Dal Dan.He Collaborates in 2012 with the austrian national radio \u0308ORF in recording the cd Kuddelmuddel broadcasted in the austrian radio stations.

Are there things we should change in the way we perform this repertoire nowadays?\r\n\r\nSummary of results:\r\n\r\nI\u2019m interested in 17th century English song for a long time. Listening to and performing it myself with modern scores I noticed that modern editions look very simple and \u2018empty\u2019 and that it is also performed in that way. Since I knew that Italian and French music of the same period used to have a strong costom of (improvised) ornamentation, I started wondering if this was actually also the case in music from England. To find answers to my questions I looked at the life and music of English composers starting with John Dowland and ending with Nicholas Lanier. I\u2019ve been looking into manuscripts and treatises, and I\u2019ve discovered many new things. Especially the things I found out about the music during the second quarter of the century surprised me a lot. I\u2019m sure my discoveries will surprise other people also. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of discovering many nice things about this music and about how it used to be performed back in the time. England has had strong connections with other countries in the late 16th and early 17th century. These connections influenced the musical style in England a lot. In my presentation I will talk about what these influences were and how and where they came from. I will also show different manuscripts of the time and I\u2019ll let the audience listen to beautiful music in which can be demonstrated well the difference between how we perform this repertoire nowadays and how it would have been performed 400 years ago.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nCountertenor Daniel Elgersma (1988) started singing as a boy soprano at age 6 in the Martini Boyschoir Sneek (Bouwe Dijkstra) where he soon became a chorister.

By the command of King Charles II who wished to have the same kind of music he experienced at the French court, Purcell learned the newest style of composition in England at that time. Purcell is often acknowledged as a composer who developed his own unique style combining French and Italian style. However, it was only later in his life that Purcell intentionally started to learn and adapt the Italian style to his music. When Purcell writes in the French style, can I sing it like I would sing French music, with notes in\u00e9gales and French ornamentations? Diverse interpretation on rhythmical alteration of Purcell\u2019s music have been offered by many performers till the present day, and as if there\u2019s been no conclusion reached, the interpretation is still left widely open for all performers. What was the likely custom of singers in Purcell\u2019s time? What did Purcell expect in the performance of his vocal music? Fortunately, sources from Purcell himself and his contemporaries provide immense information on what kind of ornamentation was common at the time. Together with plenty of record about what kind of trained singers sang for Purcell, we can see how far Purcell took the advantages of these star singers to write even more elaborate music. The presentation will include further look at the reliable sources I\u2019ve found on Purcell\u2019s ornamentation, introduction to the important soprano singers of Purcell to be shown through a PowerPoint presentation, as well as a live performance of an ornamented version of Purcell\u2019s song which I will demonstrate as the result of my research.\r\n\r\nBiography: American/Korean soprano Kristen Witmer studied classical and baroque singing at Tokyo University of the Arts.

I remember I was very impressed with his music: a fluency of notes in ppp\r\ncharacterized by an amazing effervescence and strange accentuation, which sometimes\r\ndevelops to fff range while going up and up in the keyboard. Practicing this music I feel\r\nlike it represents building a complex machine with a very precise mechanism... somehow\r\nnonhuman, very mechanical... I used to like a lot this kind of working time on the piano.\r\nNevertheless, I felt a bit shocked about the idea of enjoying music being a mechanical\r\npart of it. What should be our perspective as performers playing or practicing a piece by a\r\ncomposer? I realized very soon that there is not a general answer for this question, it\r\ndepends a lot on what composer we are playing and, furthermore, performers have a\r\nproper perspective of what is music for their self. I have focused my research in the\r\nsecond book of Etudes pour piano by Gi\u00f6rgy Ligeti because it contains etudes between\r\nnumbers 7 and 14. Gi\u00f6rgy Ligeti did pianola version of etudes number 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\r\nand 14-A together with Ju\u0308rgen Hocker. He introduced small differences at the score of\r\npianola and pianist version. Moreover, as we can easily guess, the musical result of the\r\nperformance of both versions are really different. The premier of \u00cbtude number 9,\r\n\u201cVertige\u201d, was made using a pianola. Furthermore, first version of \u00c9tude number 14 is so\r\ncomplex that, together with this first version, whose title is \u00c9tude 14A \u201cColoana f\u00e2r\u00e2\r\nsf\u00e2rsit\u201d, Ligeti did a simplified version: The \u00c9tude 14, \u201cColumna infinit\u00e2\u201d. At the score\r\nof \u00c9tude 14A, Ligeti indicated this piece is composed \u201cfor player piano (ad. lib. live\r\npianist)\u201d, and he wrote, \u201cplayed presto as prescribed this version is best performed on a\r\nmechanical piano (or on a Yamaha Disklavier). With appropriate preparation, a\r\nperformance by a live pianist is also possible\u201d.\r\nBiography: Born in Malaga, Spain 1989, Juan Miguel Moreno Camacho started his\r\npiano studies at the age of seven with Gordana Komericki.

It is very easy to select the etudes that one plays based on arbitrary factors. I propose here a short collection of etudes that have been chosen because of the ways in which they compliment one another. The point of this manual is to introduce a new and organized way of thinking about physical development through etudes. My aim is to introduce cellists to a way of approaching these works with utmost awareness. It is imperative that we never stop carefully considering our fundamentals, developing new techniques or pushing our acquired techniques beyond current limit. Cellists have been given the tremendous gift of a thoroughly comprehensive selection of etudes. Many of the most historically relevant performing cellists contributed to the literature through their own etude compositions. In this report, I focus on David Popper, Carlo Alfredo Piatti and Jean-Louis Duport. I have chosen two etudes by each composer that together provide an integrated and synergistic daily education in the use of the bow as an artistic medium. This is a collection of six etudes which, when practiced in succession, will establish a greater foundation for fluid and elegant artistic expression in the bow. Even more importantly, it will demonstrate a method of daily etude practice that any cellist can replicate with any etudes to solve physical problems that obstruct artistic output.\r\n\r\nBiography: Sean Hawthorne is a 23-year-old cellist studying with Michel Strauss and Jan Ype Nota at Koninklijk Conservatorium, Den Haag.

S. Bach\u00b4s works for guitar?\r\n \r\nSummary of results:\r\nEven though J. S. Bach never composed or arranged anything for guitar, through his own arrangements for other instruments, he left us some sort of study example of what changes we can make when arranging  his music for guitar. In his arrangements, Bach did not hesitate to change the original key if it was needed to make a composition playable or more suitable for the chosen instrument. If he was arranging for an instrument able to play more voices, he would often compose new voices, and similarly, the other way around. In the vast majority of cases he would have kept the original rhythm, harmony and melody, but if there was a just cause, he would have changed even that. By following his example, we can do the same when making an arrangement for guitar, but it is important to find the balance between staying close to the original and making it sound natural on the guitar. To capture both of those, would be ideal, but on the guitar we are often forced to make compromises. What to sacrifice and where the line of balance is, is personal, but some things must be respected. One must keep the core idea and character of the movement, to stay in style and to make it suitable and natural sounding for the guitar. In my presentation I will show some examples of what I did in my arrangement of Bach\u00b4s second Sonata for violin solo BWV 1003 with explanations as to why I made certain changes and also I will play some recordings of creative solutions of other arrangments.\r\n \r\n\r\nBiography: I was born in January 28th 1989 in Vinkovci, Croatia.

The period of transition between both instruments.\r\n\r\nResearch question:\r\nHow long did it take the valve horn to completely replace its predecessor and why did they coexist for such a long period of time?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nIt is crucial for professional horn players (playing both natural and modern horn) to study the origins of their instrument. Just few decades after horn became a standard instrument of the orchestra horn players and makers started to search for ways to explore it more and broaden its capabilities. The main disadvantage of early horn was its limited range.\r\nBefore the valve horn became the main instrument in this family a lot of experiments took place. The most important technique which arose from these experiments was since the middle of the 18th century the hand stopping technique. This way of playing had crucial influence on the attitude to the horn and made this instrument so distinctive. The evolution of hand stopping technique came to the point when natural horn was considered as a fully chromatic instrument. As a result, a lot of horn players did not get convinced about the invention of valve around 1815 and did not want to accept the new type of instrument which had only open sounds.\r\nThe sense of esthetic of a great part of horn players and composers was the main reason why the natural instrument remained for them the real horn. The most conservative center of natural horn playing was Paris. It was where the most important treatises of horn were written. The class of natural horn of Paris Conservatory was closed down only in 1906. But not only French musicians remained faithful to the natural horn. Johannes Brahms never really accepted the new invention of valved horn and wrote all his pieces theoretically for natural instruments.\r\nThe double horn we know from modern orchestras has been existing only since the first half of 20th century.\r\nNowadays the natural horn is experiencing its renaissance and has been used by some contemporary composers such as Benjamin Britten or Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nI was born in Pozna\u0144 (Poland) on 13th October 1987. I began my musical education at age of 13 in Music High-school in my hometown. After 7 years I decided to devote myself to music and began modern horn studies at Ignacy Jan Paderewski Academy of Music in Pozna\u0144 with dr. Krzysztof Stencel. After two years when my school opened the natural horn subject I became the first student of this instrument in Poland.

Interventions are physical or theatrical coping strategies, which can be used on stage to decrease PA. Ginette tried to create a confidential environment where there could be freely spoken about PA-related issues and to experiment with these. Through questionnaires and meetings they shared their information. The ensemble was supposed to consist solely of musicians with PA, but due to circumstances the ensemble became a mixed group of musicians with and without PA. It never came to the process of developing interventions on stage. The musicians without PA often treated the questions and meetings in a humoristic way, which decreased the sense of a confidential environment. Also, in general the ensemble lacked of cooperation, the meetings took place during rehearsals. This project could only work if all musicians joined voluntarily and worked with full commitment. Stage one ended with a concert where Ginette individually experimented with the term \u2018vulnerability\u2019 using interaction with the audience and ensemble. The recital was received as an artistic and personal performance. In the next stage Ginette using coping strategies within different ensembles and analyzed thirteen concerts using pre- and after concert questionnaires. Her hypothesis was that her nerves would decrease when her connection with the audience and ensemble was stronger, but the results indicated the opposite concerning connection with the audience. The connection with the ensemble did decrease her nerves, but not significantly. Next to that she became more objective towards her nerves as she was analyzing them, noticing that they didn\u2019t vary much throughout her concerts. One concert was considered an outlier, as her level of nervousness was extremely low. She had to support a sick colleague, which might have forced her into the role of a rescuer, with a positive effect on her nervousness. \r\nThis research helped to develop the original format for the PA ensemble project. Future plans are to realize this project.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nSoprano Ginette Puylaert studied with Lenie van den Heuvel during her Bachelor of Music at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague and graduated in 2013.

Fingers have to touch the keys to produce sound. Simply said when playing piano, a pianist is applying a fingering. It can be very useful to think more conscious about fingerings in jazz piano music.\r\nAnatomically and biomechanically seen, some research has been done on finger strength and positions. Nevertheless, the results are not spectacular. No therapist could be found with a very clear vision on anatomic reasons for certain fingerings. Only some schools that favour more flexing fingers are opposed to the \u2018flat finger school\u2019. Indeed, forceful playing requires more flexion. Fast playing might be easier with flatter extended fingers.\r\nThere is not a very \u2018common ground\u2019 among jazz pianists that thinking about fingerings is very important or not. Even though some older style pianists like Art Tatum had made up some theories and techniques on fingerings. All the contemporary pianists that were interviewed for this research had different thoughts on feeling and strength. Most importantly, these elements have the greatest effect on the sound the pianist wants to create. \r\nHowever a fertile ground for learning to play more economically (no unnecessary movements of the hand/fingers) and secure jazz piano can be made by thinking clearly about fingerings. Practising exercises like descending pentatonic runs, lines, thirds, double grips and so forth have proven to be useful to ban unnecessary movements of the hand. To aim for strong fingers on strong notes on strong moments in the bar can be effective to create an economic way of playing. This basis is very practical as material to proceed on. Proceed in a way that improvisation concepts would not be frustrated. In the end every pianist has to create his own favourite fingering for his desired feel and, most importantly, preferred sound. \r\nThe research results in a collection of pianistic exercises in order to play and think more consciously of fingerings in jazz improvisation music.\r\nThe presentation will include a look at different fingering theories and a demonstration of exercises.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nErik Verwey (Arnhem, 1987) is a jazz pianist and has (a.o) studied with Bert van den Brink, Peter Beets and Juraj Stanik.

Professional organists were interviewed about their opinions on five topics: the attention for musical methodology, the best way to approach a new score, the importance of instruments, the role of teaching, liturgical practice and concert practice and finally, memorization.\r\nThe interviewed organists do value the subject of study methodology, and consider the attention for the subject nowadays as insufficient and too much dependant of the teacher's interest. In approaching a new score several aspects can be recognized. Repetition is important, and so is analysis and understanding. The relationship between those two differs, depending on the repertoire. The choice for an appropriate study instrument is important: touch and sound have a significant influence on the quality of musical study. Pipe organs in church or home are the best options to choose. The repertoire for concerts can be played in liturgical settings too. Both worlds seem to influence each other mutually. Teaching influences the teacher as well: by reflecting on musical and technical issues it forces the teacher to be fully aware of his own decisions and interpretations. Concert preparation largely depends upon the programme, the instrument and the time available. The matter of memorization receives little attention: most of the interviewed organists never performed from memory. They do not think it is of additional value to performer or audience.

From the origins of the instrument till the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\ndifferent systems were used. One of the styles seemed to be more identified with the\r\nviolin than with the cello technique. It was represented by fingering and left hand\r\nposition, different than used today. By looking at the history of development of the cello\r\nfingering I will try to answer questions about possible reasons of applying violin-like\r\nfingering on the cello. I will examine methods employed on early bass instruments, much\r\ndebated system proposed by Corrette, and Lanzetti\u2019s and Baumgartner\u2019s approach which\r\ntransitions the diatonic and chromatic systems. I will see how Romberg and others, even\r\nthough fingering had evolved to the final level, applied oblique violin-like, left hand\r\nposition until the beginnings of twentieth century. Finally I will look at the examples\r\nfrom cello repertoire which contain fingerings, and I will analyze them in terms of the\r\nsystem used and possible ways of execution.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nPaulina Ptak embarked upon her musical education in two of the most important Polish\r\nmusical centres \u2013 the city of Cracow and Wroclaw.

What are the characteristics of these great jazz piano trios? How can understanding of these differences, similarities and characteristics help me to react appropriately in different musical situations and combinations?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nAs I remember myself jazz piano trio was always my favorite band format in jazz music. I like the simplicity of it and in the same time the magic how great players could get it to sound like an orchestra. Especially in this band format we can see how great musicians are as listeners and supportive players, there is a much bigger role and responsibility for everyone to make the music interesting and happening than in bigger settings. Individual levels are equally important because every one of the musicians can choose directions where the music will go. Music is really about collective improvisation and truly listening to each other. This \u201cplatform\u201d is great to explore dynamics, interaction and to become as a one \u2013 a great rhythm section.\r\n   After listening to all these albums and analyzing what the drummer chooses to play I understood that it\u2019s not just the drummer\u2019s personality that counts, but big impact to drummers decisions are what the other two band members are doing and suggesting in music. One needs always listen to each other and go one way musically. One\u2019s job within jazz trio setting is to make other musicians sound good and make their job easier and more comfortable. This setting is really fragile and it can work only if each member of trio is working towards the same goal. In different jazz styles the basic fundament of drummer is the same \u2013 to keep music going with nice feel and energy.\r\n   During my presentation I will show and explain how I applied specific exercises/concepts in my playing and I will perform with my own jazz piano trio to show different ways, approaches to play within this setting in different styles, with knowledge gained from this research.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n   Pauls Pokratnieks is jazz and other improvised music style drummer and composer.\r\nUp until the age of 18 he actively performed in various local and international orchestras as a classical percussion player and took first prizes in competitions.

P. Telemann\u2019s 12 Fantasias for unaccompanied violin?\u201d\r\n\r\nResearch Summary: Transcription is a very important part of the classical guitar tradition, as most of the original repertoire for the guitar has been transcribed from the manuscript. This is because the composers did not always have complete mastery of the guitar. The transcriptions of early music provided guitarists in the early 20th century, with a valuable addition to an otherwise sparse repertoire. This contributed to bring the guitar into the classical limelight, and its recognition as a serious instrument ensued. One genre of music which has been, and still is, popular to adapt to the guitar, is the unaccompanied solo pieces from the Baroque era. The implied polyphony of the solo violin music is often possible to realise on the guitar. This research investigates the different aspects of the transcriptional methods, specifically when working with music for unaccompanied violin. By using Carlo Marchione\u2019s transcription of G. P. Telemann\u2019s first Fantasia as an example, an analysis of and a comparison with the urtext sheds light on the different decisions, which are involved in the process of making a functional version for the guitar. The presentation will include visual and auditory explanations of the different possibilities, excerpts from an interview with Marchione, and examples from the score analysis presented through PowerPoint.\r\n\r\nBiography: Thomas was born in 1989 in Bergen, Norway and started playing the guitar at the age of 7.

Given this evidence, what ideological and practical factors might inhibit modern performers from incorporating this evidence in their own interpretations today? \r\n\r\nSummary of Results: \r\n\r\n\tThe exploration of documentary and sounding evidence relating to the performance style of Johannes Brahms and his contemporaries reveals much to modern performers about the difference in performance styles between the nineteenth century and our own. The documentary and sounding evidence examined in this research project demonstrates that Brahms and his contemporaries played within a much wider spectrum of expressive possibilities, revealing more\u00a0accelerandi, ritardandi, and independence between voices, than our controlled modern interpretation of Brahms would allow. Ideological and practical factors however discourage modern performers from implementing this evidence into their own performances: pressures of fidelity, authenticity, text-centricity, and the diminished role of performers as compared to composers have all contributed to the constant scrutiny of performers'\u00a0interpretative choices, and have increased the risks associated with performances viewed as expressively licentious.\u00a0\u00a0Practical application of this research via documented performance experiments however shows that modern performers can, when aware of the above historical evidence as well as the ideological pressures they face, implement stylistic tools from the past into modern interpretations of Brahms's works. For my own performances of the Brahms Opus 120 Sonatas, this research project has informed my interpretation, resulting in recordings of increased fluidity of phrasing, a more expansive range of expressive freedom, and an overall stylistic shift towards greater artistic freedom and a natural interpretive flow that is less hindered by societal pressures. My recordings also demonstrate that this research is not only relevant within the Opus 120 Sonatas, but transferrable across all of Brahms\u2019s music. The goal of this research is not only to expand expressivity in my own performances, but to offer this evidence to other performers who may struggle with the question of expressivity when performing Brahms as well.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\n\r\nRaissa Fahlman is a devoted clarinet soloist, chamber and orchestral musician.

This paper answers the question of how to use feedback, advice and judgments during an exam, and during the preparation of it. Feedback is information about how we are doing in our efforts to reach a goal. Important when giving feedback is that the learner is aware of receiving the feedback, and that the comments are objective. Advice is an opinion or recommendation offered as a guide to action. Important when giving advice is that the person receiving the advice is willing to receive advice and understands on what feedback the advice is based. A value judgment is a judgment of the rightness or wrongness of something or someone, or of the usefulness of something or someone, based on a comparison or other relativity. Judgement is an important part of an exam. For students it is important to know what the criteria are, and towards what they have to work to. To understand more of the learning process, different aspects of playing a string instrument are discussed in the fifth chapter. These aspects are technical facility, musicality and performance quality. The different phases in a musician\u2019s preparation are discussed in the sixth chapter. From learning the score till mastering a piece. In this research all those aspects are combined to offer a guideline for juries and guideline for teachers during the preparation. Recommended for the examinations of the Royal Conservatoire would be to draw up a set of criteria, which are clear for the students and for the teachers who will grade the students.\r\nBiography: Barbara Bekhof (1991) first started playing the violin at age 6.

The focus of the practical sessions of the author was on her\r\ndynamic range. The purpose was to increase flexibility in her dynamic range in the\r\ndifferent registers of the voice. The research went through the following process: (1) an\r\naudio recording of G. F. H\u00e4ndel aria: \u201cSe Piet\u00e0 di me non senti\u201d, from the opera Giulio\r\nCesare; (2) in this same phase of the research, she used the software Voice Profiler 5.1 to\r\nrecord her Voice Range Profile (VRP), the same piece and the vowel /a/, throughout the\r\nvocal registers, exploring the complete dynamic range of her voice; (3) after three months\r\nof practicing specific exercises designed to train the dynamic range, the same recordings\r\nwere made and also a comparison with the first ones. The results indicated that the\r\ntraining had an impact: An increase of flexibility in realizing Messa di Voce was verified\r\nin the author\u2019s middle vocal register. This impact did not happen in the highest vocal\r\nregister, where technical differences were not detected by the VRP recording. The latest\r\nresult is also applicable in the H\u00e4ndel aria. This method has proved to be beneficial in the\r\nmiddle section of the author\u2019s vocal range. The appliance of this method is a work in\r\nprocess, which the author believes that it should bring more beneficial results; it offered\r\nthe author a much bigger awareness of the breathing system, which resulted in a better\r\nquality Messa di Voce. The knowledge gained from the sources from the 18th and 19th\r\ncenturies, guided the practical study in this investigation.

M\u00fcller and F.C. Franke appeared\r\nin the Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik, which discussed various aspects of double bass playing.\r\nThe two double bassists agreed on some points, including that the double bass has a very\r\nimportant role in the orchestra, that there was a lack of good double bass players at the\r\ntime, and the general characteristics of a good instrument; but they debated other\r\nsubjects, such as playing stance, left hand technique, bow technique, the components of\r\ndaily practice, and the common practice of simplifying double bass parts. Their\r\ndiscussion on these topics has implications for historically informed performance,\r\nespecially in regards to the performance of orchestral works. During my presentation I\r\nwill briefly discuss the historical background of my research, including biographical\r\ninformation, the state of double bass playing in the mid-nineteenth century. Using\r\nrecorded audio and video examples and live demonstrations, I will then discuss the\r\npractical components of this artistic research: Franke\u2019s and M\u00fcller\u2019s opposing fingering\r\nmethods, and M\u00fcller\u2019s suggested modifications of the double bass parts of Beethoven's\r\nsymphonies.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nShanti Nachtergaele grew up in California (USA), and holds a Bachelor of Music degree\r\nin Double Bass Performance from Shenandoah Conservatory, where she studied with\r\nDonovan Stokes.

This was known as the Gallant Style. Music had different purposes and this specific repertoire, the accompanied sonata, such as pedagogical purposes was used in gatherings to entertain guests and give young ladies an opportunity to share their artistic accomplishments with their fathers, brothers or husbands who would accompany them on the violin. Many were the composers who dedicated these compositions to their students and patrons, and many were the publishers who attributed a quota of their catalogues to it. \r\nThe keyboard sonata with the accompaniment for violin was a fashionable genre during the second half of the eighteenth century in the popular capitals of Europe such as London. Though this repertoire seemed to have an important role in the eighteenth century music consumption, nowadays little attention is given to it. This research aims to bring alive a genre now in oblivion, exposing the importance of rediscovering a repertoire which is part of the early music composers\u2019 legacy.\r\nThis research, presented through a visual aid and illustrated in audio excerpts, will expose the most important facts involved in the practice and development of this repertoire as well as its main characteristics.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nI am a Portuguese harpsichordist, who came to The Netherlands pursuing a deeper knowledge of Early Music performance.

Are there suggestions from current physiological\r\ntechniques that can inform and improve how we approach playing the baroque cello?\r\nWhat can the treatises and iconography from the 18th - 20th centuries tell us about\r\nholding and playing the cello without an endpin?\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nWhen Luigi Boccherini\u2019s body was exhumed in the 1990s, expert analysis concluded that\r\nthis famous baroque cellist suffered numerous musculoskeletal injuries, many of which\r\nwere a direct result of his profession. Baroque cello playing had caused skeletal changes\r\nin his spine and legs significant enough to still be evident in his mummified body nearly\r\n200 years after his death. Musicians place huge strains on their bodies for the sake of\r\ntheir art, made even more apparent by the condition of Boccherini\u2019s remains. Fortunately,\r\nawareness of the physical strain and injury suffered by many musicians is rapidly\r\nincreasing, and so too have scientific studies, health practitioners, and music teachers\r\naugmented the focus on physical health for enabling a lifetime devoted to music. The aim\r\nof this paper is to discover suggestions and methods for minimizing physiological harm\r\nwhen playing the cello without an endpin. Of course, there is no one answer, one cure,\r\none ideal posture for baroque cellists. This paper will not present the one best way of\r\nholding the cello that will ensure an injury-free, painless career. Rather, this paper will\r\npresent suggestions, thoughts, and ideas gleaned from an investigation of cello treatises,\r\nphysiological research, health practitioners, fellow cellists, and iconography. The\r\npresentation of this research will include visual examples, written instructions, and\r\nphysical demonstrations as suggested by the historical sources and contemporary experts.\r\nComparison off the different recommendations will ideally assist fellow baroque cellists\r\nin combating the postural tendencies and pitfalls of holding the violoncello.\r\nBiography:\r\nOriginally from Salem, Oregon, USA, Annabeth obtained dual bachelors degrees in Cello\r\nPerformance and Neuroscience at the University of Michigan in 2012, and a bachelors\r\ndegree in Baroque Cello from the Koninklijk Conservatorium in 2013.

In order to achieve this, I have studied the historical, cultural and musical context of the time, the teaching methods employed in the Neapolitan conservatories, the skills the pupils were expected to acquire (with special attention to the cellists), and the main roles and duties of professional cellists in the Neapolitan musical scene. I present some biographical information on the main Neapolitan cellists of the period, and offer a catalogue of Neapolitan Baroque cello repertoire. Moreover, I have included in my paper an edition and a recording of two of the pedagogical sources discussed in the paper, in order to further illustrate it and to give an idea of how these materials could have been used in the period.\r\nAfter having completed my paper, I really believe that we, as modern-day performers, should get more inspired by the approach to music learning that the Neapolitan conservatori had. Specifically as historically informed musicians, we should try to get as close as possible to these practices, since this would bring us a better insight about how this music was thought, composed, learnt, experienced and performed. As Neapolitan music became so influential in the middle of the 18th century, and as the pedagogical tools used at the conservatories spread through Europe, this approach might in fact be expanded to an even broader context.\r\nThe research presentation will include a slideshow presentation and audio files which will bring an idea of the learning resources that on that time and period were used to teach the cello.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nIn\u00e9s is a musician specialized in the historical performance of the cello and the viola da gamba.

By 1723 Weiss had modified one of his instruments for the use in the orchestra and the church so to resemble in the effect the standard theorbo, but with a different tuning, that mirrored the tuning of the lute of that time (now referred to as \u201cbaroque lute\u201d). This lute-like tuning, while still retaining in the power and resonance of the standard theorbo, allowed the \"new\" instrument a bigger extension both in the high and low registers, and a strong connection to the aesthetic and techniques of the lute. In the context of my own exploration, description and re-introduction of this lesser-known type of theorbo, both practical and theoretical, this thesis aims to also support my claim that Weiss' theorbo is often the most appropriate instrument to realize a 18th Century basso continuo in a historically accurate way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\nGiulio Quirici studied jazz and baroque music.

Part of\r\nthe reason why may come from the way this music has been preserved. The flute\r\nsonata was written on the same autograph manuscript as Bach\u02bcs Concerto for Two Keyboards in C minor, but part of this manuscript has been cut off, leaving us with over 40 measures of the flute sonata missing. Bach\u02bcs death in 1750 prevented him from publishing in its entirety one of his most complex movements from the Art of the Fugue: Contrapunctus 14. Fortunately, breakthroughs in modern scholarship, together with inspiration from reconstructive processes in other genres, make it possible to develop appropriate reconstructions of these pieces. The music can then be made suitable for performance and more accessible to today\u02bcs audiences. This presentation will show the methods and strategies I used to reconstruct these two pieces, along with the\r\nchallenges I faced, and will feature a performance of both works.\r\nBiography:\r\nMichael Peterson has performed nationally and internationally as a soloist and chamber musician.

It is known that people with ASD can be drawn to music, as also shown by\r\nanecdotal evidence concerning musical savants. In addition, there is a higher incidence of\r\nabsolute pitch in people with ASD than in the normal population. With my expertise both\r\nin music and clinical child and adolescent studies, I wondered whether there is a\r\nscientific basis for the use of music therapy in the ASD population. According to a large\r\nbody of research, this is in fact the case. Processing deficits associated with ASD seem to\r\nbe less present for musical information. Despite characteristic difficulties in perceiving\r\nemotions in the self and others, ASD causes no problems in perceiving emotions in\r\nmusic. Perceiving details as well as global musical information, people with ASD are\r\nvery attentive listeners. The ASD brain seems to have a priority for musical over social\r\nauditory information processing. Given the preference for a clear and structured\r\nenvironment, music \u2013 as a highly structured stimulus - seems to calm and even reward the\r\nASD brain. Research on efficacy of music therapy interventions has shown\r\nimprovements in joint attention, eye contact, social engagement, socio-emotional\r\nreciprocity, verbal communication, attention, and motivation. The strength of their\r\nmusical brain can be of great use in motivating and engaging people with ASD to work\r\non goals in all possible domains.\r\nBiography:\r\nHelmke Jansen began her student years at the University of Leiden in 2006, where she\r\nstudied Education and Child Studies combined with the minor Practicum Musicae at the\r\nRoyal Conservatoire in The Hague.

Its nobility \u2013 Princes, Electors and even the Emperor himself - highly appreciated the viola da gamba as a refined musical instrument, and learning to play it commonly formed part of their education from childhood onwards. Often, they were themselves involved in the preparation of major musical events such as the performances of operas which were the high points of festivities, such as Carnival, birthdays, and name days. While the Viennese court favoured Italian opera and employed a large number of Italian artists, quite a number of Italian and German composers also came into contact with the French style during study visits to Paris or through French colleagues employed at German courts. Thus, Baroque opera in Germany is mainly Italian at heart but also absorbs other elements such as German counterpoint and the French style. To relate the viola da gamba to opera performed in 'Germania' may at first sight seem surprising as we would associate it rather with chamber music and in the case of vocal music mainly with sacred cantatas, especially funeral music. The research process has shown that the viola da gamba indeed played a role in German baroque opera. New discoveries of pieces from operas and opera-like works performed at German courts such as Hanover, D\u00fcsseldorf, Dresden and Berlin demonstrate the varied use of the viola da gamba as an obbligato instrument, solo or in combination with other instruments, and as basso continuo instrument."}, {"id": 62476, "type": "exposition", "title": "Easter Lamentations for solo voice in Spain during the 17th century", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/52/75/5b/1d/52755b1d4ad6a9153353d2bbfdea7d6d.png?t=5f67fa3c182d14ed02cf3fa99fd688c7&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/62476/62477", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=62476", "keywords": [], "created": "25/01/2014", "last-modified": 1432640064, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "26/05/2015", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 534751, "number": "3", "title": "Internal publication"}, "author": {"id": 61476, "name": "Victoria\tCassano McDonald"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Victoria Cassano\r\n\r\nMain subject: Early Music Singing\r\n\r\nResearch coaches: Ra\u00fal Angulo, In\u00eas de Avena Braga\r\n\r\nTitle: Easter Lamentations for Solo voice in Spain during the 17th century\r\n\r\nResearch Question: What information is available about the performance of Easter lamentations for solo voice in Spain and how can we get closer to their historical performance practice?\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe Easter lamentations are musical settings of the texts from the book of Lamentations by the prophet Jeremiah, describing the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 b.c. They are sung during the Triduum Sacrum, the last three days of the Holy Week - Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday -  during the Tenebrae service. Many composers have set music to these texts through history, including Victoria, Lassus and Tallis. In the 17th century lamentations for solo voice with instrumental accompaniment started being composed all over Europe, and became very popular especially in France, where they receive the name of \u201cLe\u00e7ons de Tenebres\u201d, with the famous settings by Charpentier and Couperin. In Spain it was also a popular genre, but it has not yet been studied in depth and there is not much information available about its performance. \r\n\r\nThis research started with the goal of discovering a repertoire unknown to me before, getting as close as possible to its historical performance practice, and being able to perform some of these pieces, some of which have not been performed in centuries. One of the objectives was to get to know how many of these pieces survive and make a list of the ones that have been already discovered. I have so far managed to put together a list of over thirty lamentations for solo voice from different musical archives in Spain. Some of these works have been catalogued in their respective archives, but are not yet available for the general public as they have not yet been edited nor performed in modern times. \r\n\r\nStudying musical treatises of the time such as Cerone (1613), Torres (1702), Nassarre (1723) and Valls (1742) I have discovered many useful aspects of performance practice that can be applied to the performance of lamentations,  such as the singers who performed them, the instruments that were used for their accompaniment, including the harp and the dulcian, and the basic rules of accompanying sacred music. \r\n\r\nIn my presentation I will show some musical examples of lamentations for solo voice, applying some of the rules found in these treatises as well as using historical pronunciation of Spanish Latin, together with a powerpoint presentation with some general characteristics of the music of the time.\r\n\r\nBiography: \r\nVictoria Cassano (Madrid, 1987) began her musical studies playing both piano and violin in her hometown.

The present\r\nresearch is an attempt to reconsider the analytical results of those authors and to propose\r\na more detailed analysis, applying to the afore mentioned vocal works the analytical\r\ntheories recently developed for the analysis of instrumental repertoire by scholars W.\r\nCaplin (Classical Form), J.

On the one hand, musicians tried to imitate the a cappella choir with homogeneous instrumental consorts, or whole consorts, where the instruments belonged to the same family. On the other hand, they tried to maintain the polyphonic texture clear, letting instruments with a very different timbre play in a mixed choir, or mixed consort. Based on a wide array of sources (letters, chronicles, iconography, inventories, instruction treatises, and surviving instruments) my Research Paper investigates the possibilities of combining the flute with other instruments and with voices in mixed consort settings. My main conclusion is that whole and mixed consorts did not follow a completely separate development, but the two choirs would often overlap and integrate in many different combinations, with much freedom and invention. This consideration should encourage modern performers of secular Italian music of the sixteenth century to keep their mind open to the possibility of transforming a cappella compositions into colorful ensembles mixing voices and different instruments.\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nGiuditta Isoldi studied at the Conservatory of Florence, where she graduated in Flute with Paolo Zampini.

And, is it possible to construct a definition for Music Theater?\r\nResearch Process: I used the word \u2018music theater\u2019 to describe the hypernym and the word \u2018Music Theater\u2019 to describe the subgenre. First, I researched the history and the evolution of the tendencies in Music Theater as hypernym genre and made a historical overview from the beginning of Music Theater up until the emergence of the subgenre \u2018Music Theater\u2019. I focused on the development of Music Theater as a subgenre.\r\nIn order to find out what the essence of Music Theater is, I analyzed the three major components of Music Theater. I made an overview of challenges that a creator faces in Music Theater and proposed several solutions, which are based on reasoning and existing performances. I tried to see as many performances as possible, which in the widest sense could be considered to be Music Theater, in order to get a wide overview of present day streams and chose six performances that in my opinion are perfect examples to illustrate my concept of Music Theater, and analyzed the various components of these works (such as music, visuals and text) in detail. Finally, I worked towards a new definition of Music Theater.\r\nSummary of Results: Music Theater is a heterogeneous but symbiotic performance genre, which is constructed with a multitude of art forms. The name might suggest that the main focus lies on music and theater. However, any existing art form can be included. The art forms can be divided into three major categories called components: music, theater and visuals. Each art form is equally important as Music Theater is based on the structural equality of voices. Music Theater is constructed by first distilling four innate languages out of the art forms and then applying them to either the same art form or inducing them into another art form: musical language, verbal language, body language and visual language. Each language element has a valuable existence of its own and\r\nis an autonomous element of the performance that adds a particular atmosphere to the whole picture. The languages are either layered in the performance or the aspects of the performance, such as the protagonists (human or material) or the art forms themselves. Music Theater is a performance genre that rather focuses on the impact that it has on the audience than on the compositional art forms. It is outcome-based and not medium-based. This creates space for each audience member to have a completely personal experience and interpretation of the Music Theater performance."}, {"id": 29553, "type": "exposition", "title": "Reading Garoto \u2013 a study over the legendary musician who changed Brazilian music.", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/61/f5/10/40/61f5104000c452b7e9531bcd71ff2ee1.png?t=b508cd6be5a2f945bc76416623f77d92&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/29553/29554", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=29553", "keywords": ["Garoto", "Brazil", "jazz", "bossa nova", "arranging", "piano"], "created": "02/10/2012", "last-modified": 1410265663, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "09/09/2014", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 28088, "name": "Henrique Gomide"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "This research was based in an investigation over the life and importance of the Brazilian composer \"Garoto\" (Anibal Augusto Sardinha), as well in my personal experience with his work.

Studying literature by osteopaths and CST therapists such as John Upledger, Michael Shea, David McFarland and Michael Kern has given me insight about the nature of CST, its background in osteopathy and some basic knowledge of anatomy. In addition to the theoretical background I used my own journey with CST as an example and looked closely at how CST has helped me. I interviewed my singing teachers Gerda van Zelm and Rita Dams and my osteopath Ami Shamir about my technical and artistic progress and wrote about my own perception of the development. To understand more about how CST and singing could work together I interviewed Hamburg-based singer, singing teacher and CST therapist Stefanie Hoffmann.\r\nSummary of Results: CST, which has its roots in osteopathy, uses gentle manual techniques to detect and release restrictions that occur in the body as a reaction to trauma (injury, surgery, illness). The rhythm of the cerebrospinal fluid that flows around the brain and the spinal cord, called craniosacral wave, is a stable motion that is not influenced by heart rate or breathing. It is palpable because its waves are transmitted through membranes enveloping all structures of the body (fascia) and can therefore be used to detect areas of restricted movement. Some areas of the body are frequently places of restricted craniosacral movement, e.g. all major transverse/horizontal structures such as diaphragm, pelvic floor, cranial base and thoracic inlet. These areas happen to be crucial for singing as well. For example a free diaphragm is very important for a singer\u2019s breath support or a free jaw and neck (connected to cranial base and thoracic inlet) are crucial for flexible articulation. CST\u2019s techniques for release of the transverse structures can therefore be highly beneficial for a singer. The body\u2019s numerous functional connections can produce symptoms as a sort of chain reaction in various parts of the body after trauma. CST can help find the cause of the problem and help release the tension by facilitating the body\u2019s own motion. My development as a singer has been greatly supported by CST, because CST was the therapy form which addressed my initial problem (difficult birth, vacuum delivery: pressure on head, neck and spine) at its core, at the level of the nervous system. My body reacted to this treatment with (lasting) structural changes, which have made breathing, articulating and resonating easier for me. CST is certainly a good tool for a singer to become more aware of his/her body.

My historical overview was based on a more in-depth analysis of just over thirty of these and I also interviewed twenty-seven historical flute players, of various ages and levels to acquire an understanding of the current approach towards technical development.\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nBy examining a large variety of flute instructional methods written across three hundred years I have discovered that there is a continuous relationship in ideologies associated with the development of sound, articulation and finger technique on the flute. This continuity of ideas, combined with the results of my interviews with current student and professional historical flute players has brought me to the conclusion that it is quite valid for historical flute players to include methods intended for Boehm system flutes as part of their practice material.\r\nI have found evidence supporting the fact that eighteenth century flute players included technical exercises as part of a daily practice routine, apart from their repertoire practice. I have also found that the most popular and enduring exercises in use today, many of which us flute players know from our modern flute studies, have their foundations in material found in eighteenth and early nineteenth century method books.\r\nIn my power point presentation I will offer various examples from my research material highlighting the development of technical material from 1700 to the present.

Throughout my childhood, I listened to Romanian folk music a lot (every week, we went to a caf\u00e9 in The Hague where Romanians would play their music), so I have quite much personal experience with it as well (I sometimes played along, and had my own \u2018gypsy\u2019 ensemble). Only one valuable book on Enescu has been published in the west, in 1990, namely \u2018George Enescu: His Life and Music\u2019 by N. Malcolm. A lot of biographical and musicological information on Enescu I could find in here, but I really needed my father to translate the Romanian sources I had collected. I had the chance to quote Enescu himself, because he did some extensive interviews with B. Gavoty. As for the arrangement, I am a pianist myself, and played and studied a lot two piano-pieces in the past. With the help of my coach, composer Theo Verbey, I made my own arrangement for two pianos of Enescu\u2019s Romanian Rhapsody no. 1 opus 11.\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nFirst of all, one can find the arrangement I made of the Romanian Rhapsody no. 1 opus 11 by George Enescu in the Appendix. I make clear how I made this arrangement for two pianos, and why I made it like this. The main goals were to keep the material as much intact as possible, but while doing this, I wanted to make sure both piano parts were very \u2018playable\u2019, very \u2018pianistic\u2019. Secondly, I wanted to know how this piece has been influenced by Romanian folk music. In order to be able to do this, I had to determine what \u2018Romanian folk music\u2019 actually is. So I tried to narrow it down to the most distinct and prominent characteristics. I did this in chapter three, in which I started by quoting Enescu himself on the subject. According to him, the music of his country is full of \u2018dor\u2019 (\u2018Sehnsucht\u2019), and there is \u2018sadness even in the midst of happiness\u2019. Shifting between major and minor also occurs frequently, I noticed. When I started analyzing songs I knew from my childhood, and started looking for characteristics on the internet, in chapter four, I deminstrated that there are some elements which appear in most of Romania\u2019s folk music, concerning instruments, scales and modes, meter and rhythm, ornamentation, \u2018doina\u2019 and gypsies."}, {"id": 64886, "type": "exposition", "title": "Combining Coco, Arranging for Het Coco Collectief", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/64886/64887", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=64886", "keywords": ["sopranos", "pianist", "ensemble", "singing", "arranging"], "created": "14/02/2014", "last-modified": 1409908383, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "05/09/2014", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 27145, "name": "Jannelieke Schmidt"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Jannelieke Schmidt\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Classical Singing\r\n\r\nResearch Coach: Patrick van Deurzen\r\n\r\nTitle of Research: Combining Coco, Arranging for \u201cHet Coco Collectief\u201d\r\n\r\nResearch Question:How do I arrange from a market, artistic, voice technique and stylistic point of view mostly single-voiced by piano accompanied music for \u201cHet Coco Collectief\u201d which consists of five sopranos and one pianist?\r\n\r\nResearch Process: In order to develop my skills, theoretic knowledge and insight in the process of making arrangements I studied sources concerning music theory and chord writing, I made several arrangements, I interviewed arrangers and singers, I had my fellow Coco colleagues answer questions about their preferences concerning singing in the ensemble and I analysed my arrangements.\r\n\r\nSummary of Results: \r\nMy paper contains all the information I gathered over a two year research period. It has become a little handbook of tips, tricks and rules. I gained skill and knowledge mainly through trial and error, rehearsals with the ensemble and analysing my interviews and questionnaires. I arranged three pieces by Rossini (La pastorelle delle Alpi, La Danza, La legend de Marguerite) one piece by William Bomcom (Amor) one piece by Johannes R\u00f6ntgen (Op een Kwal) and one piece by Bizet (Adieux de l\u2019hotesse Arabe). I used La Danza en La legend de Marguerite as material to compare arrangements before and after my research in order to detect differences in choice making and using gained knowledge and skill. I used Op een Kwal en Adieux de l\u2019hotesse Arabe in order to explain how a piece changes through a rehearsal process and adapting the piece for either stage of radio.\r\nThrough talking to the arrangers and working on my pieces together with my coco colleagues and my research coach I found what I was looking for: skill. From the beginning of this research I was looking for justification of my choices. I found that for me to feel secure of my work I needed those two years of thinking that rules is all I needed. That if I could explain an idea by saying it there because of a style or historical context, from a voice technical of personality choice, from Coco\u2019s image or other peoples opinion my arrangement would be good enough. If I could find arguments and explanations for why I did what I did, I should not have to justify why I dare to rearrange already \u2018perfect\u2019 repertoire. I created the handbook, containing tips tricks and rules: music theory, all the knowledge shared with me during interviews, Coco\u2019s preferences, all the rules are there. Everything in order to be able to let go of them if it pleases me. My choices are still based on knowledge but now I can consciously use or not use the rules. I have developed a greater trust in my own artistic ideas about the pieces I arranged. I have developed a greater understanding of what it is to write for this ensemble, for these people. And as said before I have created a little booklet of rules for anyone who wants to arrange for voices and piano.

An Analysis of the Great Walking Bassists of the 1950s and 60s.\r\n\r\nResearch Question: In theory, a bass player's walking quarter notes should not swing, as they are not syncopated like eighth notes are for example; syncopation being a necessary condition of what it is to swing, in that it allows for the long-short lilt that people identify with swing music. In practice however, it is evident that certain bassists are able to create a swing feeling, through a highly complex, and often idiosyncratic approach to quarter note placement within the 'big beat,' as well as to sound production and articulation. By using sonic visualization software such as Audacity, my goal is to shed light on the unique and often highly mysterious properties behind swinging bass lines: are there strategies in common between swinging bassists, or does each performer swing in their own inimitable way; do swinging bass lines rely on a temporal tension between bassist and drummer; and to what extent are the timbral properties of an instrument and the attack with which a string is engaged relevant?\r\nResearch Process:\r\nMy research process involves four phases: Firstly, selecting contrasting examples of swinging bass players from the 1950s and 1960s; secondly, studying selected examples using Audacity, creating a visual data set that will then be used to examine what the similarities and differences are between each bassist's approach to swinging quarter notes; thirdly, examining whether the push and pull of swinging quarter notes results from either tension or synchronicity between a bassist and a drummer, as well as what effect the tonal shape of the quarter notes the bassist plays, as related to timbre and attack, have on swing feel; and fourthly, examining my own instincts with regards to the spectrum and parameters of the various swinging quarter notes of each bassist studied.\r\nSummary of Results: I have recently discovered in my own playing, that regardless of which drummer with whom I am playing, that my time feel needs to remain strong and unchangeable by what it is they are doing. This allows me to swing immediately and consistently on my own, or with whomever I am playing, provided the drummer is competent. All of this together answers my initial questions of: Do swinging bass lines rely on a temporal tension between bassist and drummer? No. Can the bassist swing his quarter notes all on his own? Yes. To what extent are the timbral properties of an instrument and the attack with which a string is engaged relevant? Extremely. In undertaking this study I have had the opportunity to think critically about a major parameter of jazz bass performance that is highly ephemeral and rarely quantified, though at the end of this project I now realize that that major parameter, while reliant on time, is actually sound and articulation."}, {"id": 97172, "type": "exposition", "title": "Keyboard transcriptions of orchestral works by M.

Marais and J. Ph. Rameau\r\nResearch Questions:\r\nHow did French Baroque composers adapt orchestral works for the harpsichord? What needs to be observed when making new transcriptions based on historical examples?\r\nResearch Process:\r\nOften, as a harpsichordist, one needs to transcribe or adapt an orchestral piece for keyboard, either when accompanying or even if only to understand it more deeply for continuo playing.\r\nThe motivations of playing orchestral excerpts that were not yet transcribed, or which are currently known nowadays is perhaps the main point of my research. It relies on the analysis of the examples of transcriptions realized by Jean-Henri D\u2019Anglebert (1629- 1691) from several works by Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687), the 1693 Anonymous transcriptions from Alcide by Marin Marais (1656-1728), and Jean-Philippe Rameau\u2019s (1683-1764) Les Indes Galantes (1735). In order to apply the results of these analyses, I transcribed a few instrumental excerpts from the operas S\u00e9m\u00e9l\u00e9 (1709) and Les Bor\u00e9ades (1764) by Marais and Rameau respectively, and will present a report on how the transcriptional process was made.\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nI believe that the results of my research have opened up new perspectives in this field, and provided new historically informed transcriptions for solo performance. With the examples analyzed, the present study detailed important aspects of the transcriptional process and unraveled many of its issues, concerning compositional techniques involved on translating an orchestral piece to harpsichord in two different periods of French music. As mentioned above, it is extremely important for a harpsichordist to identify which tools were used to idiomatically translate an orchestral writing to a keyboard one, if only for a better understanding compositional practices, the solo repertoire and for the development of a more historically informed accompaniment. My research aimed to identify more clearly what could be considered a \u201cFrench harpsichord language\u201d, considering its sound qualities and different possibilities of interpretation, and how it was used in two major periods of French music, symbolized in this context by Marais and Rameau, and their impact on the musical life of nearly a century.

What historical precedence exists, in what musical contexts would the practice be used, and how does this realization sound when used in performance?\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe cello was used as a continuo instrument from the earliest days of basso continuo through the early nineteenth century. In addition to the cello being used as a single-voice continuo instrument, evidence exists that some cellists realized their continuo lines, creating multi-voice chordal accompaniments. Accounts of performances in which cellists played chordal continuo realizations exist, though very sporadically, ranging from 1657 to 1834. Despite arguments from a number of scholars and performers that the use of chordal continuo realizations by cellists was widespread during the eighteenth century, there is insufficient evidence, much of which is highly circumstantial, that the practice was common before 1774. Several treatises were published between 1774 and 1834, however, that give clear and detailed instructions, including examples of execution, for the use of chordal continuo realizations on the cello in secco recitatives in opera. The use of this practice at that time sheds an interesting light on the role of the cello, the development of cello technique, and about the virtuosity required for this type of accompaniment.

Is it possible to establish bibliographic control of this research, and outline the major deficits in existing literature?

Is there a further link between his output and his position in various European ensembles, suggesting a development in line with other composers?\r\nResearch Process:\r\nMusical emigration was quite characteristic in Czech musical life in the eighteenth century, but was not a completely new phenomenon. Throughout history Czech emigrants, such as Jan V\u00e1clav Stamic, Franti\u0161ek Benda or Josef Myslive\u010dek, came to well-deserved fame, but others await a return to modern appreciation. This is surely the case when we consider the life and work of Ji\u0159\u00ed \u010cart (1708-c.1778). Despite the contemporary success and reputation, \u010cart\u2019s name has fallen into insignificance. No thematic catalogue has ever been attempted, leaving performers with no basis for modern performance, and thus audiences with limited opportunities to hear and discover his music. This thesis is potentially a model for further extrapolation of his output and a beginning of a more developed research path. However, the scope of this current document is limited, and therefore centres on \u010cart\u2019s flute Sonata in D minor.\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThis work provides detailed information about the professional life of the violinist, flutist and composer Ji\u0159\u00ed \u010cart, which has yet to be considered in English. This information is embedded in the historical context, providing an overall picture of the social situation in the eighteenth century for \u00e9migr\u00e9 musicians from the Czech lands such as \u010cart. The so- called \u2018Czech Musical Emigration\u2019 is a very important ingredient of European music history, which partly influenced the direction and the onset of classicism as we now see it. \u010cart spent his adult life following his musical talents and opportunities as an \u00e9migr\u00e9. In doing so, he occupied several important posts in major European orchestras and establishments.

It is therefore a historical research based on available bibliography as well as in sources of the period.\r\nSummary of Results: Luigi Boccherini lived in Madrid or near for almost 40 years. Throughout of the 18th century there were many attempts in Spain to modernize the society, the economy and of course the culture, trying to get a closer position to the leading nations of that time. In music this resulted in the development of public concerts and opera performances, very much in the line of the spirit of the Enlightenment. But at the same time there was a lack of dissemination of printed music due to the absence of a strong musical press. That\u2019s why Boccherini published his works outside Spain where the middleclass amateur players were much more abundant. During 10 of his years in Spain Boccherini enjoyed the patronage of the infante don Luis under such favorable terms that can be compared to the situation of Haydn with the Prince Eszterhazy. We could say that even being so far from the big musical centers -Viena, Paris and London- the circumstances in which he developed his career were not so different from other composers of the time."}, {"id": 90107, "type": "exposition", "title": "Italian elements in French music for traverso by J.M.Laclair and M.Blavet", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/24/a4/43/37/24a44337d74b655f0fcd46a0cb623bd6.png?t=7e04b08febe5341ccfa656e660b81a07&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/90107/90108", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=90107", "keywords": ["Jeanne Mansfield LeClair", "Michel Blavet", "French Music", "traverso", "Fran\u00e7ois Couperin"], "created": "15/07/2014", "last-modified": 1409906747, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "05/09/2014", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 28072, "name": "Radka Kubinova"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Radka Kub\u00ednov\u00e1\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Traverso Research Coach: Bart van Oort\r\nTitle of Research: Italian elements in French music for traverso by J.M.

Their music includes many Italian elements and in my research I would like to reach a deeper understanding of the stylistic mixture. For that I need to uncover the social circumstances and back ground of the life of these two composers. I have studied French contemporary sources, mostly books written by the end of 17th century and beginning of 18th century describing musical life in France and its main musical personage. The big advantage of studying the contemporary sources in their original language is the possibility of getting the whole picture of the period.\r\n\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThe end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century in France was a \u201cgolden age\u201d for traverso marked by an intense interaction between French and Italian style. This interaction is reflected in all aspects of music: composition, forms, instruments and interpretation. The Italian style introduced many new features which were hardly accepted by a conservative society represented by aristocracy and absolutist monarch Louis XIV. Another section of the society, modern and open to anything, new was represented by very controversial and powerful person of Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans who was the most important musical patron in France at that time.\r\nThe best conclusion of the interaction between the two styles is \u201cLes go\u00fbts r\u00e9un\u00efs\u201d by Fran\u00e7ois Couperin.

This included books, websites, journal and magazine articles, and museum exhibitions.\r\nIn a practical sense, during the first year of the research process I was mainly focused on trying out different things by experimenting with live electronics both in improvised and concert music. For my second year, I have commissioned a new piece involving percussion and live electronics to be performed by composition student Siamak Anvari. I will also be the second person ever to play Hugo Morales\u2019 piece 150pF, \u201cfor body capacitance and amplification system.\u201d This piece involves a new instrument that I built myself, consisting of four jack connectors that are split into a four-channel system. As a complement for the program, I am doing a reduction of Frederic Rzewski\u2019s\r\nComing Together for one single player and an actress.\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nThroughout this text we have seen different proposals that have come out of limitations faced by artists during crisis periods: where creativity is forced to develop in very significant ways in order to keep creating pieces, performances - art that riches everybody, regardless of culture, politics, age, or other aspects. These limitations have provided artists with a lot of new instruments, technologies and techniques: tools that have helped composers and performers to develop new languages and frameworks within which to organize many different materials.\r\nIs very important to point out that the use of non-conventional instruments and live electronics can be considered when there are limitations, but we do not have to use these resources just because of the presence of a limitation, but rather as a part of an on-going research process that leads us to these resources as part of a particular creative solution. After going through all the practical examples experimented with and contained in this research, we can conclude that live electronics and non-conventional instruments are indeed an alternative to larger performance set-ups, not only when the economic situation is unfavorable, but even as a matter of taste."}, {"id": 64860, "type": "exposition", "title": "Comparisons of Perspective in the Empfindsamer Stil: How the music of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach represents a microcosm of an emerging cultural initiative", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/8e/f3/08/67/8ef308676158fe88c2f124f18e40ea7a.png?t=28ba0aa67826088e2fed41d039be243e&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/64860/64861", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=64860", "keywords": ["traverso", "Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach", "Sturm und Drang", "struggle"], "created": "14/02/2014", "last-modified": 1409905792, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "05/09/2014", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 27149, "name": "Kristen Huebner"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Kristen Huebner\r\n\r\nMain Subject: Traverso\r\n\r\nResearch Coaches: In\u00eas de Avena Braga and Jacques Ogg\r\nTitle of Research: Comparisons of Perspective in the Empfindsamer Stil: How the music of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach represents a microcosm of an emerging cultural initiative\r\n\r\nResearch Question:\r\nWhat are the musical tools available to musicians which can be used to unlock the complex understanding of the Empfindsamer Stil?\r\n\r\nResearch Process:\r\nMy research process has been the result of years working and performing the 1788 Quartets for Keyboard, Flute and Viola by Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach. Besides a deep musical analysis of these three works, the main body of my research has dealt with the developing style which is commonly associated with this music, that of Empfindsamkeit or Empfindsamer Stil. The English translation equating to \u201csensitive style\u201d is often associated with the Sturm und Drang, a highly influential literary movement of the 1770s. After reading much of the actual literature of the Sturm und Drang, including Johann Wolfgang Goethe\u2019s Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, I set out to draw a distinction between the terms Empfindsamkeit and Sturm und Drang. Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach\u2019s ersuch ber die ahre rt das lavier u spielen provided the springboard for my musical analysis of the Quartets and a subsequent categorization of three distinct musical characteristics used to describe the music of the Empfindsamkeit.\r\nSummary of Results:\r\nHaving its origins in literature, the Sturm und Drang aimed to represent an artistic struggle showing the depths and extremes of the human experience, working most often in contradiction with the mainstream Enlightenment ideology of the time, which was founded and based on man\u2019s ability to reason. Breaking away from this restrictive model, the Sturm und Drang influence crept further into cross-disciplines of poetry, theater and painting, yet striking deepest in the most ambiguous and indefinable of arenas, music. The Quartets of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach surprised and demanded a more explicit and contemplative attitude in order to perform with any real consciousness or effect. In addition to shifting roles in instrumentation with the keyboard asserting dominance over the supporting flute and viola, I have explored rhythmic manipulation and surprise, in addition to dynamic juxtaposition. Perhaps most taxing for the performer of these Quartets is the abruptness with which one must make changes in mood and character; drastic intervallic leaps, modulation to strange keys and an intentional disruption of the rhythmic pulse all contribute to a sense of impulsiveness, the suggestion of something that cannot be predicted and should be performed with an equal amount of surprise.

Can his 1535 treatise, La Fontegara, be thought of as the result of sixteenth century practice based research? What will change in our relationship to documents of the past once we look at them as analogous to our own artistic concerns? What could this understanding of artistic research as a trans-historic event mean for Early Music in particular?\r\nMy research and thesis leads me to a close reading of Ganassi\u2019s recorder and diminution treatise La Fontegara, trying to go beyond the text and its possible literal meanings and tracing the lost instrumental practice of diminution. With this first treatise of its kind, Ganassi inaugurates an age of instrumental literacy, which has irrevocably shaped our perception of musical practice.\r\nBy linking the document to its biographical, social, theoretical and practical roots I try to sketch out the possible influences and projects (both political and artistic), which took part in making this work possible, helping to understand the trans-historic significance of research in defining a place for the artist within broader society. Also, I take the chance to reflect how this critical intimacy I establish with the work changes the very core of my identity as a recorder player by shaping my practice as a dialogue with a distant and mostly silent past.\r\nSummary of Results: The goal of this research is to stress the importance of research in the arts in redefining the role of the musician within society and of opening up a new wave of debate with which to vitalize the historically informed performance movement. Ganassi\u2019s La Fontegara is a document that holds a far greater importance than that of a simple recorder tutor, which positioned it as the first document in the project of emancipation of instrumentalists and their music. Furthermore, the document should be seen as a vital part of the XVII century propaganda project of diffusing the myth of Venice through its use of speculative music tropes such as the theory of proportions. FInally, I wish to rethink our present relationship to these documents as performers. They were not musical cookbooks but rather crystallizations of a continuous struggle between the performer\u2019s knowledge and his need to describe it. To read La Fontegara, is to go beyond the treatise and speculate on the oral practice from which it stems."}, {"id": 62023, "type": "exposition", "title": "how musicians use their brains", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/c3/d2/16/39/c3d21639bd237b339e6ec9c4dd228fb0.png?t=3ec3c3c6d3a5424425b14e71b79733f4&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/62023/62024", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=62023", "keywords": ["cognition", "learning", "memory", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "21/01/2014", "last-modified": 1407405324, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "07/08/2014", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479586, "number": "2", "title": "Royal Conservatoire Investigations"}, "author": {"id": 33402, "name": "Enno Voorhorst"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "When our modern brain developed 100,000 year ago, it perfectly suited the circumstances of that time.

But one might ask oneself why lessons in sight singing are needed for students who can already read music notation? The answer usually is: to develop the aural imagination in relation to music notation. The way students have learned to read music notation in the first place did not develop this skill well enough then?\r\n\r\nExperiences in teaching made me think that we need functional note names (unique sound names) to be able to aurally understand pitch in staff notation, and that the absolute note names (unique pitch names) may be an instrumentally useful, but less effective step \u2018in between\u2019 in aural imagination.

I wondered if the keys to the high register might be found in a special reed type, or a physical technique involving, for example, jaw position?

It is important, however, to realize that the concept of artistry has to be observed in many different contexts. When doing a modest research into this concept in the context of music teacher training, I became more and more aware of - on the one hand the ambiguity of the term and the ease of the use of it on the other hand. Many teacher-training programmes claim to develop the artistic and musical expertise of students on the basis of the idea that music teachers should be artists in the first place. By my research I have tried to understand why music teacher trainers and others are so convinced about the obviousness of the artistry and musical expertise of music teachers. \r\nAfter organizing a conference with the title \"Craftsmanship and artistry\" (EAS Conference 2012), I had the opportunity to compile a book on artistry in music education. When finding the authors for the book, we had in mind to find contributions from different perspectives. Ultimately the book did focus on three main areas: the concept of artistry, pupil's artistry and the artistry of music teachers. Besides editing the book with a colleague, I was a co-author of an article on the competencies of music teacher and did write and article on artistry. I offer critical remarks on the seemingly obvious idea that music teachers should be musicians. He argues that content knowledge and skills in themselves are probably not that important for teachers, emphasizing instead that musical knowledge and skills in a pedagogical context should be a priority for educators. A second topic I raise is the role of musical identity. The fact that many music teachers would like to see themselves as musicians or think they should be, may well be influenced by the way music teachers are educated and trained. The question of what the kinds of musical expertise we should expect from music teacher is related to the opinions we have on music and music education. Finally, I discuss the complex connotations of the terms \u2018musical\u2019 and \u2018artistic\u2019 and comes to the conclusion that we had better use them critically."}, {"id": 87580, "type": "exposition", "title": "Help!

In the latter case, students start learning solf\u00e8ge as teenagers or young adults but by that time they have already developed some of the solf\u00e8ge skills through years of playing an instrument. What these skills exactly are, and what overall musical knowledge students already have, differs from one student to another. Some are already familiar with certain chord progressions, some have general knowledge about keys and intervals, some have never sung before, and some can already play by ear on their instrument. Students themselves are not always aware of the level of their skills or may have the wrong impression about them. Teachers need time to obtain an objective picture of each student\u2019s abilities. If the teacher wants to build on the students\u2019 pre-knowledge, it can be difficult to decide exactly where to start and which route to take towards the goal. Starting at the level of basic skills makes this much longer and might demotivate students; starting at too high a level will unavoidably leave gaps in knowledge. Many music theory pedagogues choose to start \u201chalf way,\u201d after first having systematized all the knowledge and skills that should already have been developed\u2014which might turn out to be both too low and too high at the same time.\r\nWhile there is much research in the domain of solf\u00e8ge issues in music psychology and there are many publications concerning classroom music, almost the only sources of information about solf\u00e8ge methodology for college-level students are solf\u00e8ge method books and textbooks. Conservatory students without previous solf\u00e8ge training are not problematized as a specific group of solf\u00e8ge-learners. In this article I am proposing that conservatory beginners are seen as a specific group of learners who are experienced and novice at the same time. I will point out and discuss several issues that are relevant to the design of the solf\u00e8ge method for this group, especially concerning the first months of learning where the foundation is being built. I will argue that learning solf\u00e8ge in general is a process with its own particularities, and that the awareness of these should be the starting point for the planning of the learning sequence. A solid foundation is seen as the requirement for any further learning, and the role of the teacher is crucial in developing or strengthening it in students. In this context the concepts such as  preparation, readiness for learning, repetition, routine, challenge and independent learning are discussed. \r\nThrough a comparison of methods for children and adult beginners, I aim to explain some of the problems that are encountered in the solf\u00e8ge pedagogy."}, {"id": 87849, "type": "exposition", "title": "From Potential To Performance.

And throughout history that relationship between music, body and mind was thematised in ever-different ways; from the proto music psychology of the Baroque Affektenlehre to the Musico- Medizin speculations of the early 20th century. Only in recent decades the study of \u2018performance science\u2019 has advanced to the level of a serious research programme, rooted in both artistic practice and in cutting-edge scholarly and scientific work, combining insights from sport science, neuro-psychology, brain science, pedagogy and musical practice.\r\nThe Royal Conservatoire does not only want to profit from this emerging field of research, but also aspires to contribute insights and experiences, embedded in its higher music education culture and embodied in the professionals who study and work here.

Just as Bart\u00f3k intended to introduce young musicians to his style, so did Berio attempt the same.  Berio's focus however, was on finding a more modern set of techniques and colors that the violin could create, and he used these pieces for children to illustrate his own ideas of theater and dramaturgy in music.  Because his ideas of theater consist of putting two completely different ideas together to make a third reality, the 1st and 2nd violin parts in his duets often sound as if they are in totally different worlds \u2013 with different dynamics, tone colors, and sometimes even tempi.  This results in a novel approach to chamber music in which each partner is equal, but also very independent of the other.  A beginning student can therefore contribute just as much musical value to a piece (indeed, sometimes much more) than a seasoned professional.  Since Berio doesn't specify the level or age that the student needs to be in order to play these pieces, this allows for a lot of freedom in the choice of performers.  The same piece can sound totally different if performed by two professionals, two young students, or one young student and one professional.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, each duet is dedicated to a friend, musician, or person that Berio admired, and can be likened to a musical portrait.  Berio said that the pieces were inspired by the \u201cfragile thread of daily occasions\u201d and therefore the pieces are not true portraits, but sometimes illustrations of an event which happened, a shared history between Berio and the dedicatee, or as in the case of Stravinsky, Bart\u00f3k, or Boulez, an homage to a piece composed by that composer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Duetti serve not only to introduce young musicians to Berio's style, but the full performance of the 34 duets is also a great introduction of 20th century musical concepts to audiences.  Since each duet is very short, there is much variety in a performance of the works, and since each duet focuses on one or two 20th century techniques while still staying in a very familiar tonal world, audiences can be challenged while still maintaining a handhold on familiar territory."}, {"id": 1136058, "type": "exposition", "title": "Research Projects Lectorate Music, Education &amp; Society 2018-2021", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/17/cc/33/ab/17cc33abe59c88ad4400ebf06682e655.png?t=1c2b59b321d80b321216f05b80fb7a67&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1136058/1136059", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1136058", "keywords": ["lectoraat", "applied research", "artistic research", "socially engaged research", "curation", "performance science", "improvisation", "craenen", "KonCon Lectorate"], "created": "28/01/2021", "last-modified": 1700757236, "status": "progress", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": null, "published_in": [], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": null, "author": {"id": 433422, "name": "Paul Craenen"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "This exposition gives an overview and access to all ongoing or finalised research projects of the Lectorate Music, Education & Society at the Royal Conservatoire The Hague (2018-2021)."}, {"id": 1095438, "type": "exposition", "title": "Classic Express Research project", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1095438/1118852", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1095438", "keywords": ["KonCon Lectorate", "performance", "storytelling", "pedagogy", "concerts"], "created": "18/12/2020", "last-modified": 1700491118, "status": "progress", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": null, "published_in": [], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": null, "author": {"id": 215199, "name": "Ilona Sie Dhian Ho"}, "coauthors": [{"id": 1038056, "name": "Vivian de Graaff"}, {"id": 1095440, "name": "Camilla Genee"}, {"id": 1095441, "name": "Ilja Venema"}, {"id": 772485, "name": "Joram van Ketel"}], "abstract": "In a combined qualitative and quantitative research the influence of storytelling in concerts for children is  analyzed.

However, in many conservatoires worldwide, both students and faculty alike often feel a long-lived desire to better align music theory subjects to the world of the instrumental and vocal students. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the music theory curriculum for bachelor students in classical music was radically changed in order to achieve just that. The changes were supported by experiences from within the theory department, discussions with students, and the influence of teachers specializing in Kod\u00e1ly-based musicianship training, or improvisation. This research project looks back at these changes to reflect on what happened, at what is still happening, and aims to explain the underlying principles of the new music theory curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe major shift that took place has replaced analysis at the centre of music theory education by aural skills development. The reasoning behind this was that, within a practice-based music theory approach, sound could be seen as the connecting element between theory and the practical musical reality of a conservatoire student. The compulsory theory subjects changed from Analysis, Harmony and Solfege, to Aural Skills & Analysis, Aural Skills & Improvisation, and Keyboard Skills & Harmony \u2013 deliberately putting an emphasis on the development of skills rather than approaching topics from a more theoretical starting point. \r\n\r\nA few years into this new curriculum we felt the need to find a more thorough theoretical underpinning for this development. The main aim was to get a better understanding of which processes concerning the development of musical literacy actually take place in a music theory lesson \u2013 or any music lesson for that matter.\r\n \r\nWith our own live-size case study as a starting point, would it be possible to find supporting data in existing literature? Or would we find mostly arguments that would invalidate our ideas? In works by Mainwaring and De Vree, as well as in articles by (a.o.) McPherson and Graybill we found models that we recognized as being a fundament for our approach. These can be connected to our model, which can be used to show connections between \u2018musical elements\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018entrances\u2019 into musical situations and phenomena.  \r\n\r\nThis research project does not mean to give a final solution for the position of music theory subjects in a music curriculum. What it does provide is a model that can be used in several ways: as a framework for teachers to develop and evaluate lessons or the content of complete subjects; in communication with students explaining the relevance of certain \u2018theoretical\u2019 activities; by students, to keep track of their own development, and in communication with management and non-theory faculty, to be able to show the place of music theory in the big picture."}, {"id": 1852421, "type": "exposition", "title": "The role of music theory in professional music education, a historic overview [Snapshot from dev system - 2022-12-06 14:40]", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/ab/1d/1b/9f/ab1d1b9f24ae7fcff6ea62014c77e099.png?t=b979ccfa0dcf6e7702364eb7cb35fbfa&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1852421/1852418", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1852421", "keywords": ["History", "music theory", "Music Education", "Conservatoires", "KonCon Lectorate"], "created": "17/11/2017", "last-modified": 1579773851, "status": "progress", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": null, "published_in": [], "connected_to": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": null, "author": {"id": 33382, "name": "Patrick van Deurzen"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "In the 19th century, we can observe a growing gap between what we call now music theoretical books and the development of music.

Whereas in serially composed instrumental music, the musical dimensions such as pitch, duration and dynamics are treated as separate parameters, in a modular approach to electronic music, the sounds themselves fall apart in parameters. Each module of the analogue system represents a specific function of sound, and together these functions form a network that is physically represented by cables on a patch field.

Firstly, although he was recognised as the main composer of Sinfonie in Rome around 1700, all of his repertoire of this genre, with the exception of one, seems to have disappeared; secondly, none of his survived orchestral scores contains evidence of the well documented practice of using winds, trumpets in particular, in conjunction with strings. To fill these gaps, speculations have tried to identify, amongst Corelli's works, not only the ones that might have originated as Sinfonie, but also those that might have included trumpets in their original form. This research moves along the same path but sets a slightly different goal: on the one hand it considers that it is virtually impossible to determine if any of Corelli\u2019s survived compositions were originally conceived as Sinfonie with trumpets. On the other hand, it argues that through a study of Lulier's Santa Beatrice d'Este oratorio - a work that preserves the only genuine Corelli's Sinfonia that has survived - and through a comparative analysis of the two Handel's Roman oratorios, it is possible to approach closely the soundscape of Corelli's Sinfonie con trombe. To achieve that goal, in accordance with contemporary Roman examples, newly composed trumpet parts have been integrated into some movements of three concertos from Opus 6. The outcome can be listened in the audio-video material part of this paper. Whether the addition of trumpets on top of a string-only movement could have been improvised, and not planned beforehand with written parts, is open to further speculation."}, {"id": 779596, "type": "exposition", "title": "Waldorf music education meets Kod\u00e1ly methodology.", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/71/f9/31/cf/71f931cf01407854986af73e9b6aa71e.png?t=71c2e5ce5afaa3b14e60e885d98c9977&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/779596/1903271", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=779596", "keywords": ["musicology", "Kod\u00e1ly-method", "Waldorf music education", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "19/01/2020", "last-modified": 1688455670, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "04/07/2023", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 708527, "name": "Raoul Boesten"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "How can Kod\u00e1ly music methodology contribute to the already existing Waldorf music education in giving the children ownership in music."}, {"id": 989375, "type": "exposition", "title": "Listening to Messiaen\u2019s colourful hands", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/22/62/16/8e/2262168ee410f9d56e4d89dc71aa5f70.svg?t=bc7bff8e21413f234bbf5270654f63c4&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/989375/1562122", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=989375", "keywords": ["chorales", "Voice leading", "homophony", "Analysis", "Harmony", "Homorhythm", "Olivier Messiaen", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "14/09/2020", "last-modified": 1661761657, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "29/08/2022", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 989099, "name": "Arjen Berends"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "Name: Arjen Berends\r\nMain subject: Master Theory of Music\r\nSupervisor: Dr. Bert Mooiman\r\n\r\nTitle of Research: Listening to Messiaen's colourful hands \r\n\r\nSubtitle: Analysing harmony and voice leading in the two homorhythmic chorales from Messiaen\u2019s La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ.\r\n\r\nResearch question: How to analyse harmony and voice leading in the two homorhythmic chorales from Messiaen\u2019s La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ?\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nOlivier Messiaen (1908-1992), one of the most famous French composers of the 20th century, was also known to be a great organist and improviser, as organist of \u00c9glise de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9 in Paris for over 60 years. His huge oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur J\u00e9sus-Christ, composed 1965-1969, includes two entirely homorhythmic movements entitled \u2018Choral\u2019. As a listener, I am fascinated by Messiaen's extraordinary approach to harmony. The aim of this research is, therefore, to attempt to understand how best to analyse Messiaen's unique harmonic language.\r\nMany approaches to analysing Messiaen\u2019s music are vertically orientated, including his own way of describing his use of harmony. He himself never discussed the horizontal aspects of his music. Because of his coloured hearing synaesthesia (son-couleur), Messiaen's analyses are particularly special in their manner of addressing the colours of certain chords. A colour analysis by Messiaen therefore may give the listener some insight in the way Messiaen might have perceived his music. This research includes videos with the music and paintings of the colour analyses by Messiaen and two other musicians with synaesthesia of one of the chorales, specially made for this research.  \r\nConsidering Messiaen\u2019s own lack of emphasis on horizontal aspects of his music, is it possible to understand Messiaen\u2019s music from a horizontal perspective as well? Since the two chorales are homophonic and homorhythmic, the bass and soprano are the most important voices. These parts can be perceived clearly, but the attention of the listener is also caught by other aspects such as the complexity of the chords. It is difficult to determine the precise voice leading of the inner parts because it is \u2018blurred\u2019 by the varied orchestration, but by way of harmonic reductions of the chorales, Messiaen\u2019s horizontal compositional techniques can be clarified. This research includes a harmonisation of a melody by Messiaen in the style of the chorales in La Transfiguration.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\n\r\nArjen Berends teaches music theory and arranging at the conservatories of The Hague and Utrecht.

However, it is a necessary part of the path leading to a fulfilling life as an orchestral musician.  The preparation for an audition certainly has specific aspects which need to be considered.  This paper discusses these aspects, based in large part on my experiences as a Principal in The Hague Philharmonic and as a committee member at auditions for many years.  As a violin and chamber music teacher as well as the teacher of the orchestral classes at the conservatoires in The Hague and Amsterdam, I have collected a wealth of experience training students to be successful at auditions. Besides the aspects of how to apply for an orchestral audition, which repertoire needs to be prepared, (including many orchestral excerpts which I have bowed and provided with fingerings myself), how to prepare effectively and what to expect on the actual audition day, there is a large section devoted to the research I have performed concerning mental and physical preparation. Developing mental skills to withstand the stress associated with auditions is an important part of audition preparation. Finally, I have researched, by means of a series of questions online and live and Skype interviews, how experts and candidates experience auditions.  This has put me in contact with leaders of orchestras from around the world.  How the two groups have responded to similar questions has put me in the position to draw some conclusions as to what committees expect at auditions and how this differs from the candidates\u2019 viewpoints.  In analyzing this research, and recognizing similarities in what I written from my own research and personal experience, I am able to draw some conclusions and make recommendations about how candidates could prepare better and be more successful at auditions.  \r\nBiography:\r\nJanet Krause is Principal Second Violinist in The Hague Philharmonic and also a violin, chamber music and orchestral studies teacher at The Royal Conservatoire in The Hague.

The term \"aleatoric\" music implies that chance determines how to fill the open spaces. The renewed approach in this research however aims to provide a score in which a performer as an improviser or co-composer is invited to shape the music according to his own opinion. The score provides a plan and context for improvised content and, in doing so, invites the performer to co-create the piece.\r\n\r\nThe research developed in three phases. In the first phase, improvisation was used as a learning tool in music theory classes. Different approaches to improvisation were studied and practiced. In the second phase, one group of musicians evolved from an improvisation course and went on a tour of five concerts. For them an open form score was created in order to provide context to the improvisations of the musicians. This composition is called View from a high mountain, a composition in six parts that allows improvisation at several moments. In the third phase, findings from the outcome and performance of View from a high mountain caused a renewal of the approach in the classroom. Through this renewal the boundary between education and musical production became a thinner line that allowed several cross-overs. Instead of a handbook containing a method or exercises or a new open form score The Improvisation Tree was created. The Improvisation Tree is a model that can be used as a help for creating, analyzing, categorizing and comparing open form scores."}, {"id": 604274, "type": "exposition", "title": "Speaking directly in an indirect way", "thumb": null, "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/604274/616470", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=604274", "keywords": ["reciprocity", "dialogue", "connecting", "art", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "10/04/2019", "last-modified": 1571662168, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "21/10/2019", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 87573, "name": "Paul Deneer"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "This essay focuses on the connection between personal and artistic growth.

In order to do this, I first visited and talked with a vast number of AT teachers who are already working on this combination, I read many key books written in the field, took AT lessons on a regular basis, and clarified and reflected upon my ideas by making video recordings of my teaching activities. Finally, I came up with a series of concrete methods and exercises for applying the core principles of AT in musical contexts. I have also made a series of short videos that demonstrate some of these ideas. In doing all of this I realized what a challenge it is to remain healthy and open in an on-going process of development, especially with all the difficulties we encounter in modern life.

Normally, the more and longer I work on a piece the more I get attached to it, but now I started to realise that I got more and more detached from some of the pieces, up until the point that I didn\u2019t want to play them anymore. However, other piano pieces remained very dear to me, and this up until today.\r\n\r\nIn short, it seemed that within 20 years I had unconsciously made my own \u2018canon\u2019 with regard to Stockhausen\u2019s piano pieces. \r\n\r\nWhat I find intriguing about this experience is to find out what the reason is for this enormous difference in appreciation for the works of one composer. Why am I sure that some piano works of Stockhausen will still be played many years from now while, in my opinion, other works will fade? Can I put a finger on differences between the pieces which can justify this? And if I can find something to justify this for Stockhausen\u2019s Klavierst\u00fccke, could this also be valid for works by other composers?"}, {"id": 456419, "type": "exposition", "title": "MONTSALVATGE AND HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE FROM THE SPANISH CLICH\u00c9 THROUGH THE ANTILLEANISM IN HIS CINCO CANCIONES NEGRAS", "thumb": "https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/b6/46/87/a9/b64687a9a9b53d5bab3d862eb295aa18.png?t=fb4b4cd0d6e4503c81804b840a8c4cd1&e=1723194300", "default-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/456419/456420", "meta-data-page": "https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=456419", "keywords": ["Montsalvatge", "Cinco Canciones Negras", "Spanish clich\u00e9", "Research by teachers of the Royal Conservatoire"], "created": "10/04/2018", "last-modified": 1537353301, "status": "published", "doi": {"id": null, "url": null}, "published": "19/09/2018", "published_in": [{"id": 6, "name": "KC Research Portal", "name_short": "KC Research Portal"}], "connected_to": [], "license": "all-rights-reserved", "issue": {"id": 479587, "number": "1", "title": "Master Research Projects"}, "author": {"id": 299003, "name": "Ana Sanchez Donate"}, "coauthors": [], "abstract": "The Spanish clich\u00e9 is an invention of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.

There are almost no horn methods based on the harmonics of the B flat horn. The traditional instrumental music lesson is mainly based on reproducing: a certain image on paper matches a fitting fingering thus producing the matching sound. When the sound is not matching the image than the teacher corrects this sound. I noticed that the children could play well when playing by themselves, but when they played together with other instruments they could easily play the whole phrase on the wrong pitch (wrong harmonics) but with the right fingerings. The horn is an instrument based on harmonic overtone series. Finding the logical steps on the valves of the horn is very difficult. Woodwind players have a logical system on the instrument playing diatonic series like do re mi. For the horn, with 3 valves, there is not a logical sequence playing diatonic series. This made me realize that some changes in the methodology are necessary for the horn to make an aural approach more logical for the beginning horn player. It also did me realize how extremely important it is for the young horn player to develop the inner hearing very well and make the logical steps from sound to symbol. My research paper investigates the possibilities to develop musical literacy in the horn lesson but also in the instrumental group lesson with transposing instruments. My main conclusion is that it is very important to make singing and moving a part of the horn lesson in order to develop inner hearing in relation to the horn. In that way the music will be understand and musical literacy can be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nKlaske de Haan studied horn at The Royal Conservatoire in The Hague and at the Fontys Conservatoire  in Tilburg with Herman Jeurissen.

Although they appear in a whole variety of ways, and can have very diverse effects, music analysis rarely pays attention to these differences.

My first research question addresses the \u2018working\u2019 of pedals and drones:\r\nHow can we explain the perceptual difference among instances of pedal tones and drones?  \r\nIn searching for the right perspective to tackle this question I have come to two concepts that inspired the further research. The first is the concept of expectation. It is mostly promoted by the writings of Leonard B. Meyer (in the more recent time it is researched and developed by others), which I take as conceptual frame. The second is the concept of interactions that defines and organizes the musical events. The inspiration for the latter came from the social studies. The two concepts are interrelated: the expectation is a product of interactions of musical elements, and the expectations are also involved in interactions, thereby influencing the perception and understanding of a musical piece. My following research questions are:\r\nCould the concept of musical expectation and the concept of interaction help explain the power of long notes? If yes, in which ways can these processes influence the perception of pedals and drones?\r\nIn the process of research, I have concluded that there are several categories of pedals/drones that are not labeled in music theory but are recognizable by many music theorists and musicians. Pointing at these categories and defining them could provide us with more words in pedal/drone-vocabulary. On the other hand, in case these models are recognizable as such, they have the potential to engage in various interactions with the other musical events in the piece, influencing the listener\u2019s understanding of it. From this perspective, it is relevant to examine them. The current research aims at pointing at a number of such models. To define them, I have used the concepts of expectations and interactions.

After meeting instrument builders, instrument collectors, and viewing and measuring many instruments in museums and private collections, I have concluded that it is possible and desirable to design and build a set of  Romantic reproduction trombones based on models of the Leipzig master instrument builder Christian Friedrich Sattler and his successor Johann Christoph Penzel, that could accurately represent the trombone sound for which Mendelssohn and Schumann wrote.

In addition, I realised that during my career as a performing bassoonist I have seen changes which I did not understand. \r\nMy study has opened the door to a wide range of possibilities and follow-up steps for me to take. I now understand why I found a number of things difficult in classical music performance. As far as I am concerned that is closely related to the fact that I was trained to reproduce music from notation, whereas I think that making music is much more than merely reproducing something. Splendid masterworks have been composed throughout musical history and I can thoroughly enjoy them if I am given the chance to play them. However, for me, that is not the only way to make my musical voice heard. I also need to speak a living musical language with my pupils and colleague musicians. If self-expression is an important part of the new learning, then I think that it is essential I develop musical expression with my pupils in order to speak a living musical language.\r\nIt would be extremely interesting in a follow-up study to investigate how the language develops and then to see what is necessary to develop a living musical language-one in which you learn to listen, speak, read, write and interpret.\r\nBy doing this research I have come to understand how aspects from the Kod\u00e1ly philosophy and methodology can be integrated into instrumental education and I can see that this is enriching.\r\nIt has given me many insights and a broad palette of tools which I can use to work in the profession in a more creative and innovative manner. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nI studied bassoon, contrabassoon and chamber music at the conservatories of Maastricht and Amsterdam at the end of the 1980s.

My background as a school teacher has taught me that singing can be used in a variety of ways to help children to learn skills such as reading and aural skills and so my wish is to investigate ways in which singing can be used in a music theory lesson at a conservatoire level.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years at the Koninklijk Conservatorium (Royal Conservatoire of The Hague), the music theory department has been investigating ways in which skills can be transferred across disciplines. One change that has been made is that many music theory related subjects are now taught as a single subject. Teachers are now free to make connections where ever they are found. My own interest is on the use of singing as a tool to achieve these ends.\r\n\r\nMy own investigation, as show in this research paper, will show models of lessons that can be created where singing is used as a core part of the lesson. A range of skills can be developed and theoretical concepts understood when singing activities are sequenced well and taught carefully. The result will be a model for other teachers to use and adapt for their own teaching.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the result of the research has also produced a collection of vocal material for teachers to use in lesson in order to encourage singing with advise on how to use it within a lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nEwan L.

My first encounter was promising and I decided to pursue this further. My research investigates possible ways to integrate the Kod\u00e1ly concept in cello teaching for children. In my research paper, first the Kod\u00e1ly concept is defined, and on that basis, existing methods and practices are analysed and examined. In addition to the study of the written sources I have also observed lessons and experimented with the materials myself. Alongside this investigation I have been integrating the Kod\u00e1ly concept in my own teaching for three years. The reflection on that experience, together with my findings from the existing methods results in the conclusion that there are many possible ways to integrate (elements of) the Kod\u00e1ly concept in cello teaching.\r\nIn the analysed methods, and in my own teaching, choices on how to integrate the concept depend on several factors. The initial perception of the concept is of influence, but also the practical reality of a particular teaching practice. I came to the conclusion that a structural, full implementation of the concept would have implications for the practical arrangement of my teaching. \r\nIn my presentation I want to show the different perspectives, give practical examples and share my thoughts on a possible way to realise the concept in my teaching practice.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nWiesje van Eersel is cello teacher at the PI, Junior and Young Talent Department of the Royal Conservatoire, where she teaches children between 5 and 12 years old.

In relation to this, I have asked various performers for feedback to see to what extent my Referential Networks are noticed and if they play a role in interpreting them. To put my composing and this research in a historical context, I look at certain aspects of European composed art music after World War II to show two different views on tradition and the past.

So when later given the opportunity to undertake a Masters Research project, I immediately knew my research question: \"How does one to become the ultimate sideman as a jazz drummer?\" This is not an easy question, and I think that in my book the answer is hidden behind the story. The main part of my book consists of two long interviews I did with the American soprano/tenor saxophonist and educator, David Liebman. Prior to these interviews I wrote roughly one hundred portraits of the musicians I've played with and the experiences I've had with them both on and off stage. I sent these writings to David, who used them to compile some very interesting questions on which we based the interviews. The first interview was conducted in 2009 and the second in 2010. Alongside the interviews, all of my portraits were also published in the book. From these interviews/conversations emerged the topics of influences, awareness of certain styles, the quarter note groove, interaction, and how to deal as a drummer with different soloist's varying approaches to the time-feel. I wrote this book especially for young and upcoming jazz drummers/students to give them some insight into real life situations through the eyes of an experienced drummer/sideman. There are hundreds of books written with great drum exercises, and I felt that another book of exercises would not add anything more to what is already available on the market. In order to collect extra feedback and to have points of comparison from the careers of my drummer colleagues, I also conducted interviews with two other well-known ultimate sidemen, Adam Nussbaum from New York and Joe LaBarbera from Los Angeles. These two interviews can be found in appendices i and ii. \r\n\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nEric Ineke started his career in the sixties. Drummers like Philly Joe Jones and Elvin Jones were his inspiration.

Made clear is that jazz, alien at first, became and integral part of the European landscape. Examples are given that once jazz was integrated into the music culture of Europe, jazz musicians in Europe made major contributions to all further new developments in jazz. \r\nWhat this paper also makes clear is that around 1977 and 2007 the cultural landscape had gone through such paradigm shifts that one can speak of three distinctive periods. \r\nA clear as possible focus on jazz as music is obtained by not primarily focusing on what \u2018great\u2019 men did, not on where exactly in Europe special events took place, nor on exact dates.\r\nThe history of jazz in Europe presented in this paper is conceived in such a way that it serves as an opening chorus, as an invitation to improvise upon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nWouter Turkenburg, (Singapore, 1953) studied classical guitar at the Conservatory of Arnhem, musicology at the University of Amsterdam, is founder of the World Music School of the Music Lyceum in Amsterdam and became head of the jazz department and teacher of jazz history at the Royal Conservatory, The Hague, The Netherlands.

This research has sought to find some of the causes and some of the possible actions to take in response. Through an extensive questionnaire and interviews with experts a number of ideas were found concerning the possible causes and various means to help those in crisis. It was found that it is important in the first years: to have free choice of instrument, to start playing and receiving lessons early, to have support in the decision to attend higher education in music. In the years of study it is important, among other things, to establish good practice habits, including an early start and more than one warm-up per day. A maximum of 4 hours practice per day and one free day per week are recommended. During the professional years discipline remains essential, and teaching trombone is strongly associated with not developing problems. Recommendations from the experts interviewed include: place focus on the music, never on the physical problems; always keep learning; let go of patterns and judgements; increase your awareness through breathing; be open and honest; stay in contact with yourself.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nPete Saunders began his career in Mexico.

This in order to improve my teaching and increase the learning outcomes of the students. Despite quite some development and improvement of lessons and material over the past 15 years I see too many students having trouble combining theory and practice. Exactly in this regard I assume that the Kod\u00e1ly concept can offer great positive effect. Since 2009 I have become practically acquainted with the Kod\u00e1ly concept through several workshops, courses and 4 visits to primary schools in Hungary.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective as a jazz musician and theory teacher the Kod\u00e1ly concept offers many valuable aspects that I will integrate: a good balance between experiencing music, musicianship skills and music theory. The musical experience is based on singing (in tune), the basic theoretical understanding is provided by solmization often combined with hand signs, and the musical material is original repertoire of master composers.\r\n\r\nSince the Kod\u00e1ly concept is mainly focussing on folk and classical art music, there is a challenge in applying the teaching elements to jazz music. The main research questions are:\r\nThe practicality of solmization and hand signs regarding the high degree of chromaticism in melody and harmony as well as tempo in jazz music\r\nTo find a form for the lesson in which improvisation and playing and are integrated as well\r\nThe research will be practice based in testing the learning material and activities with jazz students.\r\nThe material and experiences of this practice-based research will lead to a workbook for students and a teacher's manual in June 2015.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research are manifold. It has become clear for me that it is possible to teach jazz inspired by the Kod\u00e1ly concept. As a teacher the change of approach is more challenging than I expected and at times it feels like a transformation. As such it is work in progress, much more has to be done. This presentation will reflect on the status quo at this moment in the process. \r\n\r\nThe presentation will be a demonstration of a first year jazz theory class.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nErik Albjerg (Svendborg, Denmark 1972), initially studied jazz trumpet, but soon turned to Theory of Music (Jazz, BA 2000).

And does the application of the directional approach provide an effective navigation tool for the improviser while shaping the harmony? \u2028\r\n\r\nSummary of results:\r\nThe navigation system can help in the choice of logical harmonic progressions while improvising. As a navigation tool it allows harmonic movement to be felt as opposed to calculated. As a tool for invention, the arrows challenge the obvious progressions one makes habitually as an improviser and one develops a sense of the basic movements in harmony: prolongation, movement and consolidation. It is clear that a simpler organization of harmony in the improviser's mind stimulates an active imagination, stands less in the way of the creative process, and leaves more time to anticipate what lies ahead. The research experiences have reconfirmed the importance of playing with one's ears wide open while improvising. As a teaching tool the directional approach is promising, although new materials have to be developed. This is work in progress. Clearly this research is not finished here. The next step is to take the results as a starting point for changes in the teaching of improvisation. One wish is to integrate the directional ideas with certain elements from the Partimento tradition. Then there is further research needed on the relationship between the upper structures and the underlying fundamental melody, dealing with stylistic elements such as chord forms and voice leading. The presentation has the format of a report (45 minutes) as it is in fact a portfolio of many activities leading up to this very moment, including a case study and experiments with teaching an ensemble. The presentation will consist of a summary of the theoretical background, followed by improvisations played on the piano and by an ensemble to demonstrate the ideas behind the directional approach.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nKarst de Jong\u00a0studied Classical Piano with Geoffrey Douglas Madge and Music Theory at the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague and started teaching early at the conservatoires of Amsterdam and The Hague.

This was the initial experience that changed my whole teaching and also my view on Music Education in general. After several study tours to Hungary I was convinced that it would be possible to develop a Kod\u00e1ly-inspired Music curriculum for Dutch elementary schools. Musical skills should and can be taught to anyone, beginning already in elementary school and not only at conservatoire level. As Kod\u00e1ly puts it: \u201cLet music belong to everyone\u201d.\r\n\r\nSinging musical repertoire is the fundament of all Kod\u00e1ly-inspired music teaching. So I began collecting relevant repertoire for Kod\u00e1ly-inspired music lessons in Dutch elementary schools: songs, rhymes, singing games, (folk) dances, canons, quodlibets, etc.\r\n\r\nTo answer the research question I have collected many Dutch and International song books for elementary school from past to present and went through them for closer musical analysis. Besides, I researched song material at the Meertens Institute Amsterdam, organized a (folk) dancing workshop for elementary school teachers and went on study tours to Budapest and Glasgow. And of course I took notice of the repertoire that my fellow Kod\u00e1ly-colleagues at the Royal Conservatoire (KC) used. Searching and collecting repertoire became an attitude. \r\n\r\nBut searching repertoire is not a theoretical business. Therefore, in the last two years I was testing repertoire in some of my classes: 1) Jong-KC-junior-students of the Royal Conservatoire at the age of 7-9 years; these children were following a special talent education. 2) \u2018Normal\u2019 children of the age of 6-8 years at a local Dutch elementary school. \r\n\r\nTo gather the repertoire I built a database in File Maker Pro. I analysed the repertoire concerning musical parameters that are relevant to build a curriculum for Music education. The advantage of such a database is the fact that it is searchable. So when building a curriculum, repertoire can be grouped and sequenced according to the musical learning goals that are aimed at. Also staff notation, a game description and a demonstration video are provided. In the future I would like to transform this into an online database that could serve as a repertoire source for any Music teacher.\r\nAfter two years of research I can positively answer the research question. The next step would be to sequence the repertoire for the benefit of a step-by-step curriculum for the full eight years of Dutch elementary school education. Then Music at Dutch elementary schools might again become a subject that matters.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nDaniel Salbert (Nuremberg, Germany 1971), studied Music Teaching (BA 1999), Choral Conducting (BA 2001) and Music Theory (BA 2009) at the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague (KC).

Therefore, we remember some things very easily like faces, tastes, routes and also music as a part of the social interaction. Music is an essential feature of the human existence and that is why when we hear a song we like, we will most likely recognize it easily the next day. This is why commercials use images, logos and rhyming texts together with jingles. The information stays in our minds easily, and more completely when it is repeated often. I will refer to this as the natural memorization path.\r\nMemory athletes are able to learn the order of cards in 30 decks within an hour. What they use is the natural memorization path. Simply put, they take a route in their own house, and place images on this route. After learning this they walk along this route and find all the images in the right order. This system is called the Loci-system and was used already by the Greeks. \r\nMusicians can also use the natural memorization path because music also settles easily in our mind. Hearing a song even once is often enough to have it settle in our brains. For musicians, this is a very practical tool for memorization but first some work has to be done. I will go into this later. We can learn more easily, more quickly and, above all, with much more enjoyment. The work that has to be done is developing a solid and immediate translation from the music in our mind to the instrument.

The answer usually is: to develop the aural imagination in relation to music notation. The way students have learned to read music notation in the first place did not develop this skill well enough then?\r\n\r\nExperiences in teaching made me think that we need functional note names (unique sound names) to be able to aurally understand pitch in staff notation, and that the absolute note names (unique pitch names) may be an instrumentally useful, but less effective step \u2018in between\u2019 in aural imagination.

It is important, however, to realize that the concept of artistry has to be observed in many different contexts. When doing a modest research into this concept in the context of music teacher training, I became more and more aware of - on the one hand the ambiguity of the term and the ease of the use of it on the other hand. Many teacher-training programmes claim to develop the artistic and musical expertise of students on the basis of the idea that music teachers should be artists in the first place. By my research I have tried to understand why music teacher trainers and others are so convinced about the obviousness of the artistry and musical expertise of music teachers. \r\nAfter organizing a conference with the title \"Craftsmanship and artistry\" (EAS Conference 2012), I had the opportunity to compile a book on artistry in music education. When finding the authors for the book, we had in mind to find contributions from different perspectives. Ultimately the book did focus on three main areas: the concept of artistry, pupil's artistry and the artistry of music teachers. Besides editing the book with a colleague, I was a co-author of an article on the competencies of music teacher and did write and article on artistry. I offer critical remarks on the seemingly obvious idea that music teachers should be musicians. He argues that content knowledge and skills in themselves are probably not that important for teachers, emphasizing instead that musical knowledge and skills in a pedagogical context should be a priority for educators. A second topic I raise is the role of musical identity. The fact that many music teachers would like to see themselves as musicians or think they should be, may well be influenced by the way music teachers are educated and trained. The question of what the kinds of musical expertise we should expect from music teacher is related to the opinions we have on music and music education. Finally, I discuss the complex connotations of the terms \u2018musical\u2019 and \u2018artistic\u2019 and comes to the conclusion that we had better use them critically."}, {"id": 87580, "type": "exposition", "title": "Help!

In the latter case, students start learning solf\u00e8ge as teenagers or young adults but by that time they have already developed some of the solf\u00e8ge skills through years of playing an instrument. What these skills exactly are, and what overall musical knowledge students already have, differs from one student to another. Some are already familiar with certain chord progressions, some have general knowledge about keys and intervals, some have never sung before, and some can already play by ear on their instrument. Students themselves are not always aware of the level of their skills or may have the wrong impression about them. Teachers need time to obtain an objective picture of each student\u2019s abilities. If the teacher wants to build on the students\u2019 pre-knowledge, it can be difficult to decide exactly where to start and which route to take towards the goal. Starting at the level of basic skills makes this much longer and might demotivate students; starting at too high a level will unavoidably leave gaps in knowledge. Many music theory pedagogues choose to start \u201chalf way,\u201d after first having systematized all the knowledge and skills that should already have been developed\u2014which might turn out to be both too low and too high at the same time.\r\nWhile there is much research in the domain of solf\u00e8ge issues in music psychology and there are many publications concerning classroom music, almost the only sources of information about solf\u00e8ge methodology for college-level students are solf\u00e8ge method books and textbooks. Conservatory students without previous solf\u00e8ge training are not problematized as a specific group of solf\u00e8ge-learners. In this article I am proposing that conservatory beginners are seen as a specific group of learners who are experienced and novice at the same time. I will point out and discuss several issues that are relevant to the design of the solf\u00e8ge method for this group, especially concerning the first months of learning where the foundation is being built. I will argue that learning solf\u00e8ge in general is a process with its own particularities, and that the awareness of these should be the starting point for the planning of the learning sequence. A solid foundation is seen as the requirement for any further learning, and the role of the teacher is crucial in developing or strengthening it in students. In this context the concepts such as  preparation, readiness for learning, repetition, routine, challenge and independent learning are discussed. \r\nThrough a comparison of methods for children and adult beginners, I aim to explain some of the problems that are encountered in the solf\u00e8ge pedagogy."}, {"id": 87849, "type": "exposition", "title": "From Potential To Performance.

Some contributions to this volume were published earlier as articles in their own right, some have been written for the occasion. Combined in this publication they offer a rich and thorough account of the state of the art in this emerging research field.\r\nThe study of the relationship between musical practice and the physical and mental condition of its practitioners goes back to ancient Greek, to Plato\u2019s Politeia or Artistotle\u2019s Politika, where music, body and mind were conceived of as constitutive of ethos, i.e. of character, behaviour and morality. And throughout history that relationship between music, body and mind was thematised in ever-different ways; from the proto music psychology of the Baroque Affektenlehre to the Musico- Medizin speculations of the early 20th century. Only in recent decades the study of \u2018performance science\u2019 has advanced to the level of a serious research programme, rooted in both artistic practice and in cutting-edge scholarly and scientific work, combining insights from sport science, neuro-psychology, brain science, pedagogy and musical practice.\r\nThe Royal Conservatoire does not only want to profit from this emerging field of research, but also aspires to contribute insights and experiences, embedded in its higher music education culture and embodied in the professionals who study and work here.

Hans Fidom (VU), Dr. Marcel Cobussen (UL)\r\nTitle of research: Historically Inspired Improvisation - Improvising on basis of 19th-century music making\r\n\r\nResearch question: Which was the role of improvisation in 19th-century music?\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nThe average modern classical musician, the performer of music from the common practice era, tends to perform from scores only, and to treat a score like a text that should be converted into sound as precisely as possible. This is usually a one way process: without a score there will be no music. As a result of this attitude the musical languages of the common practice period have become dead languages, more or less like Latin and Ancient Greek, which are (with very few exceptions) no longer spoken actively but only translated into modern languages. More and more musicians become aware of the artistic limitations of this approach. In order to become, like musicians from the past, creative performers who are able to enter into a living relationship with the music, learning how to improvise seems to be a valuable means.\r\nThe Royal Conservatoire in The Hague (The Netherlands) invests in \u2018classical\u2019 improvisation. An environment has been created which fosters the idea that improvisation is important for classical musicians, and a lot of experience has been gathered in teaching improvisation to those students. \r\nBut what precisely do we mean with the word improvisation? And how exactly do we argue that improvisation is important for the new generations of conservatoire students? Improvisation by classical musicians is often referred to as \u2018classical improvisation\u2019 or \u2018improvisation in a classical style\u2019. These terms are not without problems, though. I would like to propose the notion of \u2018historically inspired improvisation\u2019 instead, indicating improvisation which uses thorough knowledge about music making in the past as a source of inspiration. \u2018H.I.I.\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily aim for style imitations; rather, it works the other way around: integrating what we can use from historical music practices into our own creative music making. In this way, improvisation has the potential to fertilize all our \u2018musicking\u2019 (Chr. Small) \u2013 even when we play from scores. \r\nIn my essay, a recorded student improvisation will be taken as a starting point. I will analyse and comment upon this recording, developing the idea of musical \u2018loci communes\u2019 which enables us to connect improvisation with the interpretation of a score. It is interesting to compare such insights with original treatises on improvisation, especially Carl Czerny\u2019s Anleitung zum Fantasieren auf dem Pianoforte (1829). Czerny turns out to presume skills that are no longer self-evident to musicians of today, while on the other hand issues which are nowadays important are not addressed in his text at all. Drawing upon the theory of loci communes, I will work out an example of how I think Czerny\u2019s book can still be a valuable source of inspiration today. \r\nDuring the presentation, I will focus on the concept of the locus communis, highlighting its double function as a way to recognize musical meaning in a score, and as a source of Historically Inspired Improvisations. The presentation will have the form of a lecture-recital. \r\n\r\nBiography\r\nThe Dutch pianist, organist, improviser and music theorist Bert Mooiman studied at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, The Netherlands, where he took his certificates as a solo pianist and organist cum laude. After completing his Music Theory studies in 2003 he started teaching music theory (principal subject), improvisation and piano at the Royal Conservatoire.\u00a0He performs both on piano (solo, chamber music) and on organ (solo, basso continuo). His work as a researcher and his activities as a performer meet in his lifelong interest in improvisation, which also became the topic of his current PhD research at Leiden University."}, {"id": 2890138, "type": "exposition", "title": "\u201cThink ten times, play once\u201d.

He contributed with his contributions to the development of the \"modern violin technique\".\r\nThe 24 caprices for violin are one of his best known works and have served as inspiration for numerous composers.\r\nIn addition to the violin, he composed music for mandolin, guitar, viola and bassoon. His duets for violin and guitar and his compositions for string quartet stand out.\r\nIn this work a brief synthesis is made of the valuable contribution of the Italian school of violin in the pre-Paganini period, integrated by outstanding composers and performers. It highlights the Italian influence in the development of the art of violin playing. Paganini's biography describes his great abilities that led him to be considered as the amazing, original, unique and unrepeatable violinist in the history of music. The exceptional qualities of this musician are attributed to a genetic factor, associated to his intrinsic ability and training. A description is made of the peculiar somatic characteristics that Paganini possessed based on medical descriptions and those of some contemporary musicians. It has been hypothesized by several authors that the musician suffered from a hereditary connective tissue disorder and two possibilities have been proposed: that of a Marfan syndrome or that of an Ehlers-Landos syndrome. A summary of the clinical and biochemical criteria characterizing these conditions is presented.\r\nWhat seems to be well founded is that he suffered from a \"joint hypermobility syndrome\", the true nature of which is conjectural, even if the hypothesis of a subtype III, hypermobile Ehlers- Danlos syndrome, may be favored. This condition affected him throughout his life, but contributed to make him the unrepeatable violinist he is remembered as in the history of music."}, {"id": 2925139, "type": "exposition", "title":
